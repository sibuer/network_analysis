"1";"Smoothness as a quality of care: An STS approach to transnational healthcare mediation.";"Sarah Savina Anna Hartmann";"Medical travel and transnational healthcare involve various difficulties such as the distance and disconnect between patients and healthcare providers, language barriers or logistical challenges of moving ill bodies across space. Medical travel facilitation steps in with some sort of brokerage service that contributes to overcoming or managing these difficulties and, as this paper suggests, acts to create a quality of 'smoothness'. By unpacking three salient facilitation practices, namely connecting, communicating, and coordinating, this paper conceptualises the empirically derived category of 'smoothness'. This as a disposition, outcome, and spatio-temporal manoeuvre of medical travel facilitation. Based on the way in which such practices of mediation act to create smoothness, namely in an attentive, persistent, and collective tinkering manner, this paper suggests that some practices of medical travel facilitation are productively thought not just about setting up the possibility of care transnationally, but that they are key forms of care in itself. Based on these findings, smoothness is considered to be a central but also contested quality of medical travel facilitation and brokerage in a broader sense, but as proposed here, also for care. This conclusion potentially has implications not just for the study of transnational healthcare and mediation activities, but also that of care and transnational mobilities more generally.";2024;"medical, travel, facilitation, smoothness, care"

Yet, knowledge of how the distribution of water uptake depth (WUD) varies across species, climates, and seasons is scarce relative to our knowledge of aboveground plant functions. With a global literature review, we found that average WUD varied more among biomes than plant functional types (i.e. deciduous/evergreen broadleaves and conifers), illustrating the importance of the hydroclimate, especially precipitation seasonality, on WUD. By combining records of rooting depth with WUD, we observed a consistently deeper maximum rooting depth than WUD with the largest differences in arid regions---indicating that deep taproots act as lifelines while not contributing to the majority of water uptake. The most ubiquitous observation across the literature was that woody plants switch water sources to soil layers with the highest water availability within short timescales. Hence, seasonal shifts to deep soil layers occur across the globe when shallow soils are drying out, allowing continued transpiration and hydraulic safety. While there are still significant gaps in our understanding of WUD, the consistency across global ecosystems allows integration of existing knowledge into the next generation of vegetation process models.";2024;"water, uptake, depth, species, climate"

Traditional model evaluation predominantly targets global scores on single levels. Specific prediction tasks, such as severe convective environments, require much more precision on a local scale and with the correct vertical gradients in between levels. With a focus on the North American and European convective season of 2020, we assess the performance of Panguweather, Graphcast and Fourcastnet for convective available potential energy (CAPE) and storm relative helicity (SRH) at lead times of up to 7 days. Looking at the example of a US tornado outbreak on April 12 and 13, 2020, all models predict elevated CAPE and SRH values multiple days in advance. The spatial structures in the AI-models are smoothed in comparison to IFS and the reanalysis ERA5. The models show differing biases in the prediction of CAPE values, with Graphcast capturing the value distribution the most accurately and Fourcastnet showing a consistent underestimation. By advancing the assessment of large AI-models towards process-based evaluations we lay the foundation for hazard-driven applications of AI-weather-forecasts.";2024;"ai, forecast, evaluation, convective, performance"

However, what is not adequately addressed in the current literature on urban planning ? which could also solidify the justification for more citizen inclusion ? is what happens when citizens are involved in planning from the perspective of sustainability. In response, this paper asks a key question: ?What are the implications, in the case of urban foodscape, when citizens are involved in planning from the perspective of sustainability?? This question is investigated in this paper in the domain of urban foodscapes and through qualitative interviews, with the support of maps, in the Dutch city of Almere. A novel theoretical combination of just sustainabilities and social licence to operate (SLO) was utilised to frame citizen inclusion in foodscape planning. The findings showed that based on everyday practical experiences of food access in the city, citizens were more concerned about social interaction, the representation of food from cultural origins, and local food production. This theoretical combination, as a way of deepening inclusion, would help avoid the tendency of urban planning being used as an instrument for glossing over social injustice under the guise of citizen participation. This paper, therefore, argues that SLO can be a key pathway for actualising just sustainabilities in both urban planning research and policy.";2024;"cities, diversity, planning, sustainability, citizen"
"5";"Antimony release and volatilization from organic-rich and iron-rich submerged soils.";"Jaime Nicole Caplette and S C Wilson and Adrien Mestrot";"Antimony (Sb) is an poorly understood, increasingly common pollutant, especially in soils susceptible to waterlogging. We investigated the impact of waterlogging on Sb release, methylation, and volatilization from an organic-rich wetland soil and an iron (Fe)-rich floodplain soil in a 27-day microcosm experiment. The release of Sb into the porewaters of the organic-rich soil was environmentally relevant and immediate with waterlogging (3.2 to 3.5 mg L-1), and likely associated with a complex interplay of sulfide precipitation, sorption with organic matter and manganese (Mn) (oxyhydr)oxides in the soil. The release of Sb from the Fe-rich soil was likely associated with Fe-(oxyhydr)oxide reduction and immobilized due to co-precipitation with Fe-sulfides or as Sb-sulfides. Volatile Sb was produced from the soils after waterlogging. The organic-rich soil produced more volatile Sb (409 to 835 ng kgsoil-1), but the Fe-rich soil volatilized Sb more efficiently. The negligible association of Sb volatilization with soil parameters indicates a more complex underlying, potentially microbial, mechanism and that antimony volatilization could be ubiquitous and not dependent on specific soil properties. Future works should investigate the microbial and physiochemical drivers of Sb volatilization in soils as it may be an environmentally relevant part of the biogeochemical cycle.";2024;"antimony, waterlogging, release, volatilization, soil"

"9";"How social innovations emerge in a rigid regulatory context : The case of Demand Responsive Transport in Switzerland";"Sebastian Imhof and Heike Mayer";"Demand responsive transport (DRT) solutions may improve rural transport systems. These solutions often emerge as social innovations in rural areas. In Switzerland, their planning process is embedded in a rigid regulatory framework of the public transport system. The objective of this paper is to understand in which way the regulatory framework of the public transport system influences planning processes of a DRT solution in a rural setting. The methodological approach of social innovation biographies helps to examine the necessary planning steps to start mybuxi, a DRT in two Swiss rural municipalities. Our findings show that regulatory constraints dominate the final planning stage of the social innovation. Protections of current public transport regulations hinder federal offices from subsidizing the DRT, having direct implications on the financial sustainability of the system. The findings of this paper help actors to better address regulatory questions in the early stage of the respective innovation process.";2024;"transport, rural, innovation, regulation, planning"

We analyse how densification can take a different path through processes of commoning. We particularly aim to understand how commoning initiatives can contribute to new institutional arrangements that counteract enclosure and commodification in densification. We furthermore aim to contribute to conceptual clarity in the debate on urban commons by emphasizing the different roles of so-called ?old? and ?new? commons in urban development. Our analytical framework builds on a new institutionalist approach which stresses the analysis of localized and temporary institutional arrangements negotiated among actors in a given situation. We rely on a detailed case-study of a densification project in the city of Bern (Switzerland), where publicly-owned land was redeveloped into cooperative housing and urban green space. Our findings show how densification leads to a transition phase in which institutional arrangements defining land uses and allocating access and use rights are renegotiated. These are crucial moments where processes of commoning can shape the outcome of densification, although not independently from the supportive action of the public actor. We underline the potential of new commons, even when typically transitional, unstable, and temporary. Contrary to old commons, their potential lies not so much in the ability for long-lasting resource management, but rather in the capacity to change the conditions of governance during the transition between land uses, advancing more socially-sustainable outcomes in a key moment of the urban redevelopment process.";2024;"sustainable, commoning, institutional, urban, densification"

A core approach in this field is historical ecology. We analyzed 544 historical-ecological papers to assess patterns and trends in the field. We found a high degree of interdisciplinarity with a focus on local case studies, of periods of fewer than 500 years, analyzing archival sources through quantitative approaches. The proportion of papers containing management recommendations has increased over time. To make historical ecology globally relevant, more effort should be made to utilize studies across languages, borders and worldviews. We call for high standards regarding the use of social scientific methodologies. Lastly, we argue that fostering longer-term studies and assessing the real-life impact of policy recommendations emerging from historical ecology can help the discipline better contribute solutions to the challenges facing humanity in an uncertain future.";2024;"historical, ecology, interdisciplinary, local, management"

"17";"EGU General Assembly 2024";"Felicia Olufunmilayo Akinyemi and Chinwe Ifejika Speranza";"Agricultural land area is increasing globally despite the loss of productive agricultural lands in some world regions. The knowledge about major agricultural land changes and the impacts on the quality of land in both cropland and grassland in Africa is still very limited. We conducted an African continent-wide assessment of the dynamics of agricultural landscapes (i.e., gains, losses, and net change). With pressure mounting to halt biodiversity loss and stem land degradation in agricultural areas across all world regions, promoting sustainable agriculture requires not only an understanding of agricultural land-use change but also the impacts of such changes on land quality. We identify influencing factors and model the quality of land associated with agricultural land gains and losses between 2000 and 2018. Land quality in gained and displaced croplands and grasslands was established using spatially-explicit analysis of changes in Net Primary Productivity, soil organic carbon content, crop suitability and percent yield change for five major crops of global importance grown across Africa. These are maize, rice, soybean, wheat, and alfalfa. Influencing factors in each agricultural land change area (i.e., areas of cropland and grassland gains and losses) were examined. In cropland loss and gain areas, settlement development, proximity to perennial rivers/water bodies, and access to a major road were important. For example, most land areas transitioning to cropland in Africa were associated with large distances away from major roads. The preceding finding suggests the remoteness of newly gained croplands. However, distances to a major road, waterbody, settlement, and elevation were important for explaining grassland dynamics. Land quality was better in gained croplands than in those lost, whereas gained grasslands were of lesser quality compared to areas of grassland loss. Five typologies of African countries were developed based on net yield and amount of land cultivated per crop in cropland change areas. Type 1 typifies net yield increase and cultivated land decrease, while type 2 is characterized by yield increase consequent upon cropland expansion. Net yield and land remain unchanged in type 3, while in type 4, cultivated land increased, but yield decreased for maize in 40% of African countries, and in type 5, yield and land area decreased. This study thus provides evidence about the quality of land in gained and lost agricultural areas and generalizable insights on their dynamics across Africa.";2024;"agricultural, land, quality, change, factors"
"18";"EGU General Assembly 2024";"Christian Rohr and Samuel Nussbaumer and C{'e";"Glaciers are excellent climate indicators, and the worldwide glacier retreat serves as a warning signal for the current climate change with its dramatic effects on humans and the environment. Visualizing glacier change by means of images can reach a broad public. Historical glacier images, especially from the so-called Little Ice Age (LIA, approx. AD 1300 to 1850 in the European Alps), show the earlier glacier fluctuations in a particularly impressive way and give us a unique insight into the climatic events of that time. These findings are in turn the key to understand current and possible future climate changes. The long-term research project \"Euro-Climhist\" is one of the first projects of its kind worldwide to extract historical documentary data on climate and weather from a wide variety of source types, evaluate the data accordingly, and make it generally accessible in an online database (https://www.euroclimhist.unibe.ch). Until now, the Euro-Climhist database consisted mainly of written sources and measurement data. Within this project, the Euro-Climhist database was conceptually extended to include and secure glacier images in the long term, and to make them accessible to researchers and to the public. Around 500 glacier images were specially prepared for the database and provided with the corresponding metadata, i.e., the name of the artist, the original descriptions as well as supplementary descriptions from the literature, the dating of the images, and the image type. In particular, the assignment to one of five image types - drawing, oil painting, print, photograph, or map - allows conclusions to be drawn about the accuracy of the glacier extents depicted. Besides written evidence, historical pictorial representations of glaciers allow us to reconstruct glacier extents in the Alps from the early 17th century onwards. Satisfactory quantities of historical material are only available for those glaciers that achieved the necessary degree of fame early on to attract travellers, scientists, and artists. Pictorial representations in painting and graphic arts date back to the early 17th century, but only appear in large numbers with the emerging popularity of Alpine travel during the 18th century.

One of the core mandates of HELPING, as captured under Theme 3, emphasizes the co-creation of water knowledge and communication. Even though co-creation is not novel, especially within a participatory framework, defining and providing boundaries has been challenging when viewed through a hydrological lens. Our ongoing discussions and meetings have focused on understanding the uniqueness of this Theme and how best we can HELP to utilize diverse communication instruments IN one Global world. For Theme 3, we intend to answer questions such as: (a) How best can we co-create hydrological knowledge (indigenous/traditional and evidence-based) between people and disciplines? (b) How can we improve and increase the visibility of the hydrological decade? (c) How can we provide water solutions through the active engagement of Local People? Some answers to these questions lie in focusing on bottom-up approaches to solve the water crisis in a globally changing world. We acknowledge the fluidities in HELPING regarding the co-creation of water knowledge, which underscores the recognition of variability and complexity within this endeavour. As such, we intend to be diverse in our approach by amplifying silent voices that may have been overlooked, also with a decolonial perspective, and engaging other perspectives from other disciplines, such as but not limited to social sciences and humanities, specifically those whose work intersects sociohydrology, hydro-sociology, hydropolitics and hydronarratives.";2024;"helping, co-creation, communication, diverse, global"

A maximum of 21 substances were found in conventionally managed fields, and a maximum of 12 were found in organically managed fields. The number and concentration of pesticide residues varied significantly between conventional and organic fields in 70 and 50% of the case study sites, respectively. Application records were available for a selected number of fields (n = 82), and these records were compared to the detected substances. Residues from 52% of the applied pesticides were detected in the soils. Only 21% of the pesticide residues detected in the soil samples were applied during the 2021 growing season. From the application data, predicted environmental concentrations of residues in soil were calculated and compared to the measured concentrations. These estimates turned out not to be accurate. The results of this study show that most European agricultural soils contain mixtures of pesticide residues and that current calculation methods may not reliably estimate their presence.";2024;"pesticide, residues, european, soils, concentrations"

Accurate estimation of stomatal regulation is crucial for understanding how plants respond to changing environmental conditions, particularly under climate change. A new generation of optimality-based modelling schemes determines instantaneous stomatal responses from a balance of trade-offs between carbon gains and hydraulic costs, but most such schemes do not account for biochemical acclimation in response to drought. Here, we compare the performance of six instantaneous stomatal optimisation models with and without accounting for photosynthetic acclimation. Using experimental data from 37 plant species, we found that accounting for photosynthetic acclimation improves the prediction of carbon assimilation in a majority of the tested models. Photosynthetic acclimation contributed significantly to the reduction of photosynthesis under drought conditions in all tested models. Drought effects on photosynthesis could not accurately be explained by the hydraulic impairment functions embedded in the stomatal models alone, indicating that photosynthetic acclimation must be considered to improve estimates of carbon assimilation during drought.";2024;"stomatal, regulation, optimality, modelling, acclimation"

Our analysis includes political leaders? speeches, news articles, and opinion pieces published in mainstream media outlets and social media about displaced people from Syria and Afghanistan since 2016. We build on and contribute to feminist geopolitics and refugee studies by focusing on refugee men and masculinities, teasing out the contradictions in the geopolitical narratives centred on refugee men?s bodies, and analysing their implications for representing civilisational hierarchies. Using the concept of embodied geopolitics, we show how the dominant anti-refugee discourse in Turkey operates through a series of contradictory -but eventually complementary- geopolitical depictions of refugee men?s bodies, appearance, and behaviour that simultaneously masculinise and feminise them. These portrayals present refugee men either as fighters or cowards, as modern or backward. We argue that gendered and racialised refugee bodies animate geopolitical narratives and demonstrate that bodies are not simply territories with fixed meanings. Instead, they are constantly and simultaneously inscribed with multiple meanings that operate together and, ultimately, produce international hierarchies, ethnic boundaries, and the modern/backward dualism.";2024;"displaced, men, bodies, geopolitics, gendered"

Whether and how specialized metabolites protect plants against toxic levels of trace elements is not well understood. We evaluated whether benzoxazinoids, which are released into the soil by major cereals, can confer protection against arsenic toxicity. Benzoxazinoid-producing maize plants performed better in arsenic-contaminated soils than benzoxazinoid-deficient mutants in the greenhouse and the field. Adding benzoxazinoids to the soil restored the protective effect, and the effect persisted to the next crop generation via positive plant-soil feedback. Arsenate levels in the soil and total arsenic levels in the roots were lower in the presence of benzoxazinoids. Thus, the protective effect of benzoxazinoids is likely soil-mediated and includes changes in soil arsenic speciation and root accumulation. We conclude that exuded specialized metabolites can enhance protection against toxic trace elements via soil-mediated processes and may thereby stabilize crop productivity in polluted agroecosystems.";2024;"plants, metabolites, arsenic, protection, soil"

Based on common property and collective governance, the vast majority of non-profit housing cooperatives facilitate the processes of decommodifying urban land and commoning housing (Balmer & Gerber, 2017). In many countries, governments support housing cooperatives by making public land and direct financial backing available as an affordable housing policy (Ferreri & Vidal, 2022; Barenstein et al., 2022). At the project level, municipal authorities can also facilitate the production of indoor and outdoor common spaces for care functions (Tummers & Macgregor 2019). These spaces serve for collective uses of the residents and public authorities ensure their provision through special land use plans as a project-based planning instrument. Collectivization of property and housing governance creates windows of opportunity for renegotiating care work more democratically within a group of residents rather than household-level gendered division of labour (Hayden, 1980). In this paper, we explore the potential of commoning housing through a cooperative model for enabling a community of residents that collectivizes not only the management of housing as shelter but also the maintenance of everyday life, i.e., the process of social reproduction. We interpret housing commons as going beyond a collection of private units ?in saturated space? (Huron, 2015), constituting a community of users that maintain housing while also providing access to spaces for social reproduction, more specifically, care.

While this approach is well established for major nutrients such as nitrogen, it is not yet established for trace metals. Here, we aimed to determine the fate of the micronutrient zinc (Zn) and the contaminant cadmium (Cd) that were applied with an organic fertilizer to a soil-wheat system. A pot study was conducted in which wheat was grown on an alkaline soil. The soils received green manure and/or soluble Zn fertilizer and were compared with non-fertilized control treatments (n-=-4 experimental replicates). The green manure was labelled with the stable isotopes 67Zn and 111Cd. For an efficient sample throughput, a method was provided and validated to determine enriched stable isotope ratios (67Zn:66Zn and 111Cd:110Cd) and the Zn and Cd concentrations in one analytical run. To this end, single collector ICP-MS analyses and stable isotope mass balances calculations were combined. Applying this method revealed that the addition of green manure increased neither Zn nor Cd concentrations in wheat grains due to biomass dilution effects. Isotope source tracing showed that the largest fraction of these metals in the wheat shoots derived from the soil in all treatments (Zn 87-99â%, Cd-94-98â%). Moreover, the addition of green manure increased the transfer of Zn and Cd from soil to wheat by a factor 1.9 for both elements.

This research explores developed and applied methods and procedures that promote epistemic justice between artists, climate scientists, societal actors, and the more-than-human to avoid marginalising knowledge and contribute to social justice. That means collaborations strive to co-create knowledge to increase climate and ecological justice, but the co-creation processes are not necessarily practised just and on eye level. Thus, the main research question concerns how to reach epistemic justice in terms of knowledge co-creation regarding the climate crisis between artists, climate scientists, society, and the more-than-human in art and climate science transdisciplinary collaborations through uncovering underlying assumptions and dynamics and investigating just, participatory, and pluralistic methodologies, practices, and processes. The research aims to answer this based on the three interdependent types of knowledge in transdisciplinary research. System knowledge describes the current state of the problem, followed by the target knowledge referring to the desired future scenario development based on values, norms, and system knowledge, and finally, transformation knowledge deals with initiating the actual change and how to turn system and target knowledge into practice (Buser & Schneider, 2021). Combining the concepts of ecological art, transdisciplinarity, and climate and ecological justice provides the research framework. Drawing on qualitative and transdisciplinary research methods by applying participatory interviews, participant observation, focus group discussions, actor constellation, and storywall in the context of Switzerland, I will suggest emerging challenges, issues, and inspirations in transdisciplinary collaboration processes. The case studies will provide examples from which priorities of some practices over others through reflection can be observed, which can help conduct future art and climate science transdisciplinary research projects.

The use of pesticides in agricultural fields is recognized as a relevant stressor for freshwater environments, exerting a negative impact worldwide on the overall status and health of the freshwater communities. In the present work, part of the Horizon 2020 funded SPRINT project, the occurrence of 193 pesticide residues was investigated in 64 small water bodies of distinct typology (creeks, streams, channels, ditches, rivers, lakes, ponds and reservoirs), located in regions with high agricultural activity in 10 European countries and in Argentina. Mixtures of pesticide residues were detected in all water bodies (20, median; 8?40 min-max). Total pesticide levels found ranged between 6.89 and 5860 ng/L, highlighting herbicides as the dominant type of pesticides. Glyphosate was the compound with the highest median concentration followed by 2,4-D and MCPA, and in a lower degree by dimethomorph, fluopicolide, prothioconazole and metolachlor(-S).

Particularly severe outbreaks have occurred at the breaking point of multi-day heatwaves, leading to considerable compound hazards from heat and drought meeting severe thunderstorms. The decay of blockings and heatwaves remains one of the largest forecast uncertainties and shows ties to the onset of widespread convection. Utilizing reanalysis data, we investigate the link between blocking patterns, heat anomalies and the decay of blockings with respect to severe convective environments. This analysis reveals that severe thunderstorm environments across Europe are preceded by multi-day heat anomalies and a slow-moving upper-level wave pattern. With the predictability of blockings and heatwaves extending to several weeks, improved understanding of their evolution and following convective outbreaks is imperative to advance the predictive skill of severe convection. Advancing the understanding of links between large-scale processes and meso-scale convective clusters sheds light on the reasons for current limits in forecasting convective outbreaks and highlights possible windows of forecast opportunity, where predictability can be extended.";2024;"europe, storms, heatwaves, precipitation, predictability"

These include an enhanced computation of cell severity, which now gives a specific additional weight to the radar-based, operational hail parameters POH (Probability Of Hail) and MESHS (Maximum Expected Severe Hail Size) for the real-time hail warnings. The specific warning for heavy precipitation is newly computed by using an independent severity parameter. It combines the precipitation accumulation in the cell?s footprint, measured by the volumetric radar network in the last 30 minutes, with the 60 minutes forecast for the same cell computed by the operational NowPrecip/NowPAL nowcasting systems and provides an early warning of the risk of heavy precipitation. The issued fully automatic warning is then triggered by the highest of the two warning levels. ZDR-columns detected within thunderstorm cells also have the potential to improve the nowcast of severe convection and hail. The separately computed grid-based ZDR-column area and maximum height are included in the TRT cell properties as additional real-time severe weather information for the forecasters. Finally, TRT also includes an automatic, operational lightning jump detection module for each identified storm cell with a time resolution of 2.5 minutes, as an additional parameter for severe thunderstorms.

"41";"4th European Hail Workshop";"J{'e";"Hail detection and sizing using radar is a common practice and radar-based algorithms have been developed and operationally deployed in several countries. Switzerland National Weather Service (MeteoSwiss) uses two radar hail metrics: the probability of hail at the ground (POH) to assess the presence of hail, and the maximum expected severe hailstone size (MESHS) to estimate the largest hailstone diameter. Radar-based hail metrics have the advantage of extended spatial coverage and high resolution, however they don?t measure hail directly on the ground. Therefore, they need to be calibrated and further verified with ground-based observations. Switzerland benefits from a large dataset of crowdsourced hail observations gathered through the reporting function of the MeteoSwiss app. Crowdsourced observations can contain wrong reports, both intended (jokes) or unintended (misuse), and have to be filtered before being used. Radar reflectivity is often used to remove reports where the maximum reflectivity is below a usual storm environment. However, this filtering method renders the observations dependent on the same radar signal used to compute hail metrics. Therefore, we test a spatio-temporal clustering method (ST-DBSCAN) based solely on the data to remove implausible reports. We then use the filtered dataset to make an extended verification of POH and MESHS in terms of Probability of Detection (POD), False Alarms Ratio (FAR), Critical Success Index (CSI) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS). We estimate the most skillful POH threshold to predict the presence of hail.

Two regions north and south of the Alps are analyzed separately.

Here, we assess the implications that different PA expansion strategies can have on the retention of species habitat across an entire region. Using retention of forest habitat for Colombia's 550 forest-dependent bird species as our outcome variable, we found that when a minimum of 30% of each species' habitat was included in the PA system, a pattern of PA expansion targeting areas at highest deforestation risk (risk-prevention) led to the retention, on average, of 7.2% more forest habitat per species by 2050 than did a pattern that targeted areas at lowest risk (risk-avoidance). The risk-prevention approach cost more per km2 of land conserved, but it was more cost-effective in retaining habitat in the landscape (50%-69% lower cost per km2 of avoided deforestation). To have the same effectiveness preventing habitat loss in Colombia, the risk-avoidance approach would require more than twice as much protected area, costing three times more in the process.

The lake garnered widespread attention during the twentieth century as major environmental and ecological changes modified the fish community with the extinction of approximately 40% of endemic cichlid species by the 1980s. Suggested causal factors include anthropogenic eutrophication, fishing, and introduced non-native species but their relative importance remains unresolved, partly because monitoring data started in the 1970s when changes were already underway.

In warming climate, hail frequency and its patterns of occurrence are expected to change, which is why understanding the long-term variability and its divers is essential. Therefore, this study  presents new multidecadal daily hail time series for Northern and Southern Switzerland from 1959 to 2022. Daily radar hail proxies and environmental predictor variables from ERA-5 reanalysis are used to build an ensemble statistical model for predicting past hail occurrence. Haildays are identified from operational radar-derived \"Probability of Hail\" (POH) data for two study regions, namely the north and south of the Swiss Alps. We used data from 2002 - 2022 during the convective season from April to September. The decision hailday YES / NO is based on surpassing a POH ? 80% for a certain minimum footprint area of the domains. Separate logistic regression models and GAM?s are built for each domain and combined in an ensemble model to reconstruct the final time series. Overall, the models are able to describe the observed time series well. Historical hail reports are used for comparing years with the most and least haildays. For the northern and southern domains, the time series both show a significant positive trend in yearly aggregated haildays from 1959 to 2022. The trend is still positive and significant when looking at the period 1979?2022. In all models, the trends are driven by moisture and instability predictors. In the last two decades, we can see an increase in haildays at the beginning of the hail season and an earlier and longer peak, however, there is no systematic shift in the seasonal cycle.

This is primarily due to the cumulative and cascading effects arising from the interplay of various natural hazards across space and time. However, their identification is challenging, which is attributable to the complex nature of natural hazard interactions and the limited availability of multi-hazard observations. This study presents an approach for identifying multi-hazard events during the past 123â¯years (1900-2023) using the EM-DAT global disaster database. Leveraging the 'associated hazard' information in EM-DAT, multi-hazard events are detected and assessed in relation to their frequency, impact on human lives and assets, and reporting trends. The interactions between various combinations of natural hazard pairs are explored, reclassifying them into four categories: preconditioned/triggering, multivariate, temporally compounding, and spatially compounding multi-hazard events. The results show, globally, approximately 19â¯% of the 16,535 disasters recorded in EM-DAT can be classified as multi-hazard events. However, the multi-hazard events recorded in EM-DAT are disproportionately responsible for nearly 59â¯% of the estimated global economic losses. Conversely, single hazard events resulted in higher fatalities compared to multi-hazard events. The largest proportion of multi-hazard events are associated with floods, storms, and earthquakes. Landslides emerge as the predominant secondary hazards within multi-hazard pairs, primarily triggered by floods, storms, and earthquakes, with the majority of multi-hazard events exhibiting preconditioned/triggering and multivariate characteristics.

To better understand microbial trace element cycling, a microbial mat was collected from the sinkhole systems of the western shores of the Dead Sea, a dynamic environment exhibiting diverse extreme environments. Intense arsenic enrichment was measured (up to 6.5 million times higher than current concentrations in water, and 400 times the bulk concentration in the mat). Arsenic was found predominantly as As(V) in organic molecules, as shown by XANES spectra and high?resolution elemental mapping. Arsenic cycling genes obtained from metagenomic analysis were associated with arsenic detoxification, supporting an active mechanism of As(V) uptake, As(III) efflux and organoarsenic accumulation in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the mat. Thus, we propose that such localized As enrichment can be attributed to a transient increase in As(V) concentrations in the circulating subsurface water of the Dead Sea shore and its subsequent incorporation into organoarsenic molecules through microbial detoxification processes. Our data set supports the possibility of metalloid enrichment recorded in very localized facies due to rapid geogenic fluctuations in the chemistry of the water flowing over a biofilm. In this context, this example calls for caution in interpreting metal(loid) enrichment in organic matter?rich layers and microbialites of Paleoproterozoic origin. Arsenic signatures in Precambrian organic matter and carbonate rocks may host biosignatures, including evidence for extracellular polymeric substances, As?binding and detoxification processes, without supporting arsenotrophy. However, they provide clues to better assess the paleoenvironmental conditions at the time of microbial mat formation.";2024;"microbial, arsenic, cycling, detoxification, enrichment"

Part 2: A Lagrangian analysis";"Edgar Dolores Tesillos and Stephan Pfahl";"uture changes in extratropical cyclone structure and dynamics may lead to important impacts but are not yet fully understood. In the first part of this study, we have applied a composite approach together with potential vorticity (PV) inversion to study such changes in the dynamics of North Atlantic cyclones. Here, this is complemented with the help of a Lagrangian perspective, making use of air parcel trajectories to investigate the causes of altered PV anomalies as well as the role that cyclone airstreams play in shaping these changes. Intense cyclones in the extended winter seasons of two periods, 1990?2000 and 2091?2100, are studied in Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) simulations, and backward trajectories are calculated from the cyclone area as a basis to construct cyclone-centered composites of Lagrangian tendencies and their projected future changes. Our results show that diabatic processes on a timescale of 24-h shape the cyclones' low-level PV distribution and corroborate that the increasing moisture content along with enhanced ascent in warm conveyor belts leads to amplified latent heat release and larger low- and mid-level PV anomalies near the cyclone center in a warmer climate. In contrast, projected upper-level PV changes are due to a combination of several processes. These processes include cloud diabatic PV changes, anomalous PV advection, and likely also radiative PV generation in the lower stratosphere above the cyclone center. For instance, enhanced poleward advection is the primary reason for a projected decrease in upper-level PV anomalies south of the cyclone center. Warm conveyor belt outflow regions are projected to shift upward, but there is not robust change in the associated upper-level PV anomalies due to compensation between enhanced low-level PV generation and upper-level PV destruction. In summary, our two-part study points to future changes in the relative importance of different processes for the dynamics of intense North Atlantic cyclones in a warming climate, with important consequences for the near-surface wind pattern. In particular, a larger role of cloud diabatic processes is projected, affecting the cyclones through PV production in the lower troposphere. The role of other mechanisms, in particular radiative changes near the tropopause, should be investigated in more detail in future studies.";2024;"changes, cyclone, dynamics, future, processes"

Although smaller in size compared to Atlantic cyclones, they share a similar synoptic structure organised in distinct air streams, such as the warm conveyor belt and the dry intrusion, and are associated with low-level temperature fronts. The large-scale characteristics of a Mediterranean cyclone, the properties of the associated airflows, the interaction with the topography around the Mediterranean basin, and the season of occurrence, all contribute in determining its surface impacts. Here, we take these factors into account to establish statistical links between mediterranean cyclones and weather compounds of two types, namely co-occurring rain?wind and wave?wind extremes. Specifically, compound extremes are attributed to a cyclone if they fall within the system?s impact area, using a definition that is expressly tested on Mediterranean cyclones and on the compound selection. Our results show that the majority of Mediterranean compound rain?wind and wave?wind extremes occur in the neighbourhood of a Mediterranean cyclone, with peaks exceeding 80%; the proportion of cyclone-related compounds is highest when considering transition seasons, and rain?wind events. Winter cyclones show highest compound frequency, matching with the peak winter occurrence of distinctively baroclinic  cyclones. A novelty of this work, the de-construction of the cyclones? impact areas based on the presence of objectively-identified air streams and fronts, reveals a high incidence of both types of compound extremes below warm conveyor belt ascent regions, of wave-wind below dry intrusions.";2024;"mediterranean, cyclones, compound, extremes, impacts"

This has implications for our understanding of the principal causal pathways by which tree, forest, and vegetation cover (TFVC) influence local and global warming/cooling. Many identify surface albedo and carbon sequestration as the principal causal pathways by which TFVC affects global warming/cooling. Moving toward the outer latitudes, in particular, where snow cover is more important, surface albedo effects are perceived to overpower carbon sequestration. By raising surface albedo, deforestation is thus predicted to lead to surface cooling, while increasing forest cover is assumed to result in warming. Observational data, however, generally support the opposite conclusion, suggesting surface albedo is poorly understood. Most accept that surface temperatures are influenced by the interplay of surface albedo, incoming shortwave (SW) radiation, and the partitioning of the remaining, post-albedo, SW radiation into latent and sensible heat. However, the extent to which the avoidance of sensible heat formation is first and foremost mediated by the presence (absence) of water and TFVC is not well understood. TFVC both mediates the availability of water on the land surface and drives the potential for latent heat production (evapotranspiration, ET). While latent heat is more directly linked to local than global cooling/warming, it is driven by photosynthesis and carbon sequestration and powers additional cloud formation and top-of-cloud reflectivity, both of which drive global cooling. TFVC loss reduces water storage, precipitation recycling, and downwind rainfall potential, thus driving the reduction of both ET (latent heat) and cloud formation. By reducing latent heat, cloud formation, and precipitation, deforestation thus powers warming (sensible heat formation), which further diminishes TFVC growth (carbon sequestration). Large-scale tree and forest restoration could, therefore, contribute significantly to both global and surface temperature cooling through the principal causal pathways of carbon sequestration and cloud formation.";2024;"scientific, forest, water, energy, cycle"

Researchers of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico) and Switzerland (workshop initiator) held presentations about occurrence and effects of pesticides on the environment, human health, the replacement of highly hazardous pesticides (HHP) by agroecological alternatives and the agri-food value chain. In a subsequent round table discussion, the presenters identified deficits, needs, interests and opportunities. According to them, the lack of awareness of pesticide use affects the health and safety of workers applying the chemicals. Despite Latin America representing the main agricultural area in the world with a very intense pesticide use, monitoring data of pesticides in soil, surface and groundwaters, food, as well as in humans are missing. Risks of pesticides to humans should be assessed so that authorities can withdraw or limit within \"short time\" the access to corresponding formulations on the market. Also, communication is not state of the art and should be improved as, e.g. the teaching of workers and farmers, how to correctly use and apply pesticides or the briefing of decision makers. Pollinators suffer from multiple stressors not the least due to pesticides, and alternatives are badly needed. On the technical side, the different analytical methods to determine residues of active ingredients and transformation products in matrices of concern should be harmonized among laboratories.Seven future actions and goals were identified to overcome the above deficits. Next steps after the publishing of this conference report are to harmonize and complete the information status of the presenters by exchanging the results/data already present. Therefore, a platform of interaction to address issues described above and to enhance collaboration shall be created. Samples of different matrices shall be exchanged to harmonize the chemical analysis and establish interlaboratory comparisons. Such activities might be facilitated by joining international associations or organizations, where researchers can offer their expertise, or by forming a new pesticide network for Central and South America that could present tailored projects to national and international organizations and funding agencies.";2024;"pesticides, latin america, health, environment, collaboration"

Rather than accepting this portrayal, my goal is to cultivate nuanced perspectives on the experiences of first mothers, aiming for the advancement of substantive reproductive justice and depicting first mothers as silent victims, which are just as crucial for the functioning of intercountry adoption practices as their current absence. In this context, white adoptive parents were often perceived as \"saviors\" (King, 2008, p.25), and intercountry adoption was framed as a humanitarian intervention (Rotabi & Brom-field, 2017). Moreover, the adopted children are frequently depicted as orphans and victims of war, poverty, and various crises, becoming symbolic figures employed to shape inter-country adoption practices under the guise of humanitarian aid, thus overshadowing the substantial commercial elements involved. Nevertheless, the harsh truth remains most of these children have birth parents, often born to unmarried mothers or conceived outside of wedlock.

The Transnational Brokering of Senior Care in Europe.";"Sarah Berit Schilliger";"In this chapter, I take the situation of live-in care workers in Switzerland as a starting point to explore the conditions under which collective forms of claiming rights and self-organization can become possible. I therefore examine practices of solidarity, relationships and the transfer of knowledge (for instance, concerning rights) in specific spaces in Switzerland. To analyse the convergence of practices of solidarity, I propose the concept of an ?infrastructure of solidarity? (Schilliger, 2020) and highlight four components that are key to the examined concept: a) spatial configurations and the creation of counter-spaces, b) political practices of solidarity work and alliance building, c) the formation of (often invisible) solidarity-based relations and care practices in everyday life, and d) mental infrastructures, that is, the sharing of knowledge and the production of collective awareness. This concept provides a way of exploring how practices of solidarity may become sedimented in time and space, and how broader relationships, networks and alliances with civil society actors, social movements and institutions can be built. Thus, my theoretically informed empirical analysis tries to identify elements and conditions for successful solidarity and collective action in the field of transnational care work in private households. It contributes to a better understanding of how unions and activists can draw on existing forms of solidarity and community to potentially adjust or start their organizing and campaigning work within this sector.";2024;"care, solidarity, knowledge, relationships, activism"

A significant part of this migrant workforce comprises Moroccan mothers who leave their children with relatives in order to perform this wage labour. The bilateral recruitment regime favours the employment of Moroccan women with children for this labour to ensure that workers return home at the end of the harvesting season. Drawing on multi-site ethnographic research in Spain and Morocco, this study revealed the effects of this bilateral labour regime on the intimate lives of migrant workers. We argue that the geopolitical prescriptions of this labour migration regime, along with the working and living conditions of migrant workers in Huelva, result in experiences of intimate liminality. We examined these experiences by exploring: (1) how the role of female workers as mothers becomes liminal as transnational labour agreements marginalise and outsource care obligations, (2) how governmental neglect of migrant workers' occupational health exposes them to reproductive health risks and (3) how this neglect places them in a liminal space in terms of access to healthcare, and (4) how, despite their liminality, migrant workers contest precarious conditions through everyday solidarity practices. We advance a feminist approach to liminality, emphasising the importance of an embodied, intersectional, and multiscalar perspective.";2024;"spain, berry, migrant, regime, liminality"

We analyse compound droughts for 52 catchments in Switzerland during the extended summer season (May?Oct) using the transient climate and hydrological scenarios for Switzerland (CH2018 and Hydro-CH2018) for both a scenario with mitigation (RCP2.6, 8 model chains) and without mitigation (RCP8.5, 20 model chains). In the RCP8.5 scenario the number of compound drought days is projected to significantly increase by mid-century across all greater regions of Switzerland. The increased frequency is mainly a result of more frequent events (significant) rather than longer event durations (non-significant). Models generally agree on the sign of change. By 2085, compound drought events are projected to occur in median once per catchment per extended summer season north of the Alps and every 1-2 years south of the Alps. Further, the increases in compound drought days mainly occur between May?Oct leading to a shift into the main agricultural production season and a more pronounced seasonality with highest occurrence probabilities between mid-July and the begin of October. Coupled to the increase in days and events, significantly more catchments are projected to be affected by compound droughts at the same time. In the RCP2.6 (mitigation) scenario, the increase in the number of compound drought days and events is not significant by the end of the 21st century. In comparison with RCP8.5, the number of compound drought days are reduced by 50-55% north of the Alps and up to 75% south of the Alps by the end of the century. This emphasizes the need for coordinated adaptation in combination with mitigation measures taken at early stage.";2024;"co-occurrence, compound, droughts, mitigation, Switzerland"

We propose planning the reterritorialisation of agriculture as a solution to perpetuating local agrifood activities and recovering from the pandemic. We discuss planning strategies from perspectives of access to land, the transition of farming practices, and structuring local supply chains.

Previously overlooked benefits of wood in rivers are now widely recognized. Together with flow and sediment regimes, the wood regime controls rivers' physical and ecological integrity. Yet large quantities of wood transported during floods can pose additional hazards, potentially damaging infrastructures like bridges or dams and exacerbating flooding. However, unlike the water and sediment regimes intensively studied over the past decades, the instream wood regime or budgeting has been only recently defined and thus is still rarely quantified. The instream wood budget describes the cascading processes from supply or recruitment, entrainment, and transport to deposition, storage and decay (i.e., fragmentation or decomposition). These processes show high spatial and temporal variability but can be characterized by magnitude, frequency, timing, duration and mode. Instream wood budgeting is challenging, primarily because of the lack of observations, monitoring stations, and standardized protocols to acquire data. This contribution reviews the most recent advances to quantify the different instream wood budget components, notably the wood supply, and transfer. Case studies showing applications of biogeochemistry, videography, artificial intelligence, numerical modelling or tracking illustrate the current progress. Because critical challenges remain, we identify and describe some of them and discuss how the wood in riverine sciences may develop in the future.";2024;"large, benefits, hazards, processes, challenges"

For effective climate change adaptation, information about microscale surface cover, structures, and human activity in cities is needed to depict the underlying causes of urban heat stress. The framework of ?Local Climate Zones? (LCZs) classifies and standardizes urban areas based on such characteristics. To date, most LCZ mapping workflows use satellite imagery as input. The resulting maps may lack some important details, and thus benefit from the use of additional geodata. We introduce a novel approach that combines the geodata of urban canopy parameters with the remote sensing-based LCZ map of Bern, Switzerland. City-specific urban canopy parameters are calculated and used to adjust established value ranges, if necessary. The most common misclassification patterns are identified and misclassified pixels are corrected using a decision tree and k-nearest-neighbor algorithm. Results show that the conformity with the urban canopy parameter values markedly increased, especially in the distinction of water surfaces, non-built areas, and building height. However, for high-resolution LCZ maps, this also leads to unnecessary heterogeneity, which may require further postprocessing. Given sufficiently available urban canopy parameter data, the proposed workflow is simple and easily adaptable for other cities. It could prove useful in urban climate studies and city planning to enhance an existing LCZ map in a contextualized manner quickly.";2024;"urban, heatwaves, lc, mapping, geodata"

This study considers the case of Nigeria, where various natural ecosystems are being converted and for which a current national scale assessment is lacking. Producing Landsat-based time-series, we analyze change among land-cover types (i.e., tree-covered area, grassland, wetland, waterbody, cropland, artificial surfaces and otherland) across seven agroecological zones. The annual intensity of change was assessed at multi-levels across two time-intervals (i.e., 2000 ? 2013, 2013 ? 2022). Distinguishing between natural land-cover and human activity related land-use, we estimate the extent of change signifying how humans have appropriated natural land-cover. Insights from analysis at the interval level reveal that land transformation accelerated from 3.3% in 2000 ? 2013 to 4.5% during 2013?2022 in all agroecological zones (e.g., rainforest, mangrove), except in Sudan and Sahel savannah where speed was higher in 2000?2013 as grasslands were increasingly cultivated. Cropland expanded two-fold (22% to 37%), whereas treecover declined from 50% to 31% and wetland from 7% to 3.7% over the 23 years. Much loss of natural land-cover (e.g., tree-cover, grassland and wetland) to cropland mainly occurred in 2000 ? 2013 (22%) when most irrigation schemes in Nigeria were established. In contrast, the loss of natural land-cover to settlement (0.9%) during 2000 ? 2013 increased to 2.0% in 2013 ? 2022. Of all agroecological zones, the mangrove zone was most disturbed as its persisting land-cover areas reduced from 69% to 5% between 2000?2013 and 2013?2022. The amount of persisting land-cover was highest in the Sudan Savannah at 44% in 2000?2013 and 49% in 2013?2022.

Consequently, various studies have attempted to link ZDRC characteristics to severe weather development, such as tornado formation, intense precipitation, and hail. Much of this work, specifically on hail, has been done on case studies with limited ground truth hail data and using S-band radar data. Here, we investigate the characteristics of ZDRC automatically detected on an operational C-band radar network and relate them to hail on the ground using 173?000 crowdsourced hail reports collected over a period of 3.5 years in Switzerland. The automated detection of ZDRC in the alpine region provides challenges regarding visibility and data quality due to effects such as ground clutter and the shielding of the radar beam by topography. Further, ZDR measurements are affected by the effects of differential attenuation and artefacts such as three-body scattering. To counteract these effects, we derive a 3D composite of ZDR using all five Swiss weather radars, two of which are located at an altitude of close to 3000m above sea level. This composite is then used to identify ZDRC by an adapted version of an established detection algorithm. The detected ZDRC areas and heights, as well as maximum measured ZDR values, are linked to reported hail size categories, and we attempt to determine thresholds to differentiate between storms producing hail of different sizes and non-hail-producing storms. Further, we investigate the potential of ZDRC to nowcast hail for possible warning applications. Switzerland is a unique location for this work due to the high frequency of hail, the good overlap of the radars, the scanning strategy with an exceptionally high spatial and temporal resolution and the large number of hail reports from the population.";2024;"radar, zdrc, hail, switzerland, detection"

For example, a dense cover of hail may clog drainage systems, consequently creating a situation favoring flooding by subsequent rain. In this exploratory study, we investigate this phenomenon of co-occurring precipitation types, first in a case study of the 28th of June 2021 in Switzerland, a day with substantial damages caused by convective storms, before following up with an analysis of the whole convective season of 2021. For the co-occurrence analysis, we require data with high temporal and spatial resolution and good spatial coverage, which is challenging in the complex alpine topography. For both hail and rain, we use datasets produced by the Swiss weather radar network, which consists of f ive c-band radars at altitudes between 900?3000m. Further, the rain dataset is created using rain gauge data to improve the accuracy of the radar-based rain estimates. The case study showed that hail and rainfall co-occurred in large areas, with 88% of the cooccurrence areas experiencing extreme rainfall within 10 minutes of each other. The proximity, large impact area, and high cumulative amount of rainfall after the hail likely contributed to the costly damages of the 28 June 2021 hail event. Further, the seasonal analysis has shown that the cumulative amount of rain after the first hail detection is significantly higher than before. However, these results are not homogeneous in space or time but exhibit regional variation. Additionally, we find that the co-occurrence of hail and rain is impacted by the estimated maximum hail size as well as by the presence of cold fronts. Finally, we also explore the reliability and limitations of using radar data for the estimation of both hail and rain, e.g. addressing the challenge of errors in radar rainfall estimates arising from the presence of hail stones.";2024;"hail, rainfall, damages, radar, analysis"

With a newly developed radar-based, mesocyclone-detection algorithm, a recent study has characterized the occurrence and evolution of supercell thunderstorms in the Swiss Alpine region. That study highlights the influence of orography on both storm intensity and occurrence frequency. To disentangle the different influential factors, an idealized modeling framework is established here using the mesoscale model CM1. The modeling scenarios are based on a high-CAPE environment with unidirectional shear, where a warm bubble serves to initiate the convection. Mimicking the environment of the southern Prealps in central Europe, scenarios with a high mountain ridge, valleys and lakes are explored. The effect on the supercells of the slopes, high-altitude terrain and moisture sources emphasizes the highly localized nature of terrain effects, leading to a heterogeneous intensity lifecycle with transitory enhancement and weakening of the supercell. The dynamic and thermodynamic impact of mountain valleys with lakes increases the range of atmospheric conditions that supports supercellular development through horizontal vorticity production, increased storm relative helicity and higher moisture content. This influence results in a systematic location dependence of the frequency, intensity and lifetime of supercells, as also found in observations.";2024;"lakes, supercell, mountainous, terrain, evolution"
"90";"Advances in Debris-flow Science and Practice";"Pascal Horton and Luigi Lombardo and Martin Mergili and Volker Wichmann and Ashok Dahal and Bastian van den Bout and Richard Guthrie and Manfred Scheikl and Zheng Han and Matthieu Sturzenegger";"Regional debris-flow hazard assessments provide consistent information on potential hazards over large areas, often with limited available data. Different approaches to regional debris-flow hazard assessment include heuristic, empirical, statistical, or physically-based techniques. The resulting product is often a debris-flow susceptibility map that identifies locations where such events are more likely to occur. These locations can also be related to frequent events that have occurred in the past and are therefore more likely to occur in the future under similar conditions. This chapter provides an overview of these different approaches and a description of the models available at the time of writing. It details the assessment of the potential source areas and the runout, as well as how these two steps can be coupled. Some data-related issues and other challenges are then discussed. The first common problem is data scarcity, which impacts methods in different ways. Physically-based methods are demanding in terms of input data, while data-driven models require event inventories that should be as exhaustive as possible. Landslide inventories are important for every regional-scale approach, and compiling such an inventory is time-consuming and often biased due to mapping preferences. This raises questions about the impact of the completeness of these datasets and whether incomplete inventories still provide reliable predictive maps, mainly for data-driven models. As has been repeatedly demonstrated, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is an essential dataset for most methods, and its quality has an impact on the results of both the source areas assessment and the runout computation. In addition to the accuracy aspect, its resolution has a substantial impact on the calculated derivatives such as slope gradient or curvature, as well as on the modelled runout. Low-resolution datasets lack certain terrain features that may be relevant, but DEMs used at too high of a resolution are likely to add noise for regional-scale studies. These impacts may be overlooked by end-users. In light of these challenges, it is important to recognize that the data collected to run our models is a snapshot of the state of the environment at a given time. Yet we live in a changing environment, with, for example, changes in topography due to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, avulsions, debris deposition, and human constructions. In addition, the climate is changing, affecting the frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events, and consequently the frequency with which debris flows are triggered. As a result, new sites with little or no history of debris flows may be affected in the future. On the other hand, more frequent debris flows may reduce the volume of sediment transported in catchments with limited supply. A changing environment therefore brings uncertainties to the data used by our models, which may underestimate or overestimate potential susceptibility to debris flows in the future. With this in mind, we discuss the perspective of dynamic approaches. Finally, regional methods have several limitations. They rely on data available for large regions, but do not account for local watershed characteristics, such as sediment supply linked to specific geological processes. Site-specific conditions can also influence the runout computation, leading to atypical debris-flow trajectories. Additionally, regional models are not designed to provide reliable volume estimates or frequency-magnitude relationships, making them unsuitable for quantitative risk assessments, modelling specific events, or designing mitigation structures. Typically, the susceptibility map serves as the initial step in prioritizing areas requiring detailed debris-flow hazard mapping.";2024;"regional, hazard, approaches, data, challenges"
"91";"Automated Input Variable Selection for Analog Methods Using Genetic Algorithms";"Pascal Horton and Olivia Romppainen-Martius and Simon Lukas Grimm";"Analog methods (AMs) have long been used for precipitation prediction and climate studies. However, they rely on manual selections of parameters, such as predictor variables and analogy criteria. Previous work showed the potential of genetic algorithms (GAs) to optimize most of the AM parameters. This research goes one step further and investigates the potential of GAs for automating the selection of the input variables and the analogy criteria (distance metric between two data fields) in AMs. Our study focuses on the prediction of daily precipitation in central Europe, specifically Switzerland, as a representative case. Comparative analysis against established methods demonstrates the superiority of GA-optimized AMs in terms of predictive accuracy. The selected input variables exhibit strong associations with key meteorological processes that influence the generation of precipitation. Further, we identify a new analogy criterion inspired by the Teweles-Wobus criterion, which consistently performs better than other Euclidean distances and could be used in classic AMs. In contrast to conventional stepwise selection approaches, GA-optimized AMs display a preference for a flatter structure characterized by a single level of analogy and an increased number of variables. Overall, our study demonstrates the successful application of GAs in automating input variable selection for AMs, with potential implications for application in diverse locations and data exploration to predict alternative predictands. In a broader context, GAs could be used to perform input variable selection in other data-driven methods, opening perspectives for a broad range of applications.";2024;"analog, prediction, genetic, optimization, variable"

Academic and practitioner understanding is now converging around the need to manage fire risk as an outcome of intersecting governance regimes, comprising geohistorically defined institutions and decision-making pathways shaped by earlier wildfires. We investigate this proposition through a case study of Italy, a country greatly affected by wildfire and characterised by strong organisational, socio-cultural and geographical variation nationally. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study collecting and analysing qualitative data on how different national and sub-national governance procedures interrelate to promote particular risk management strategies, and support or impede adaptive change. Participants in key agencies were consulted across seven nationally representative regions. Findings show a highly fragmented institutional structure, where wildfire policy responsibilities are increasingly allocated to disparate organisations at a variety of scales. Local stakeholder participation has been displaced by this shift to extra-local actors and networks. While institutions are formally committed to adopting a precautionary approach to wildfire risk, in practice, emergency response remains the default choice, as a result of patchy and uncoordinated legislation. Notably, the wider national and international (EU) regulatory context plays a muted role in governing wildfires. We present our results as a novel action research agenda for Italy and southern Europe more generally, emphasising the urgent need to develop new anticipatory systems of wildfire incidence through closer integration of cross-scale governance arrangements.";2024;"fire, risk, governance, italy, institutions"

However, how policy integration may be achieved or hindered remains unclear, particularly in the case of coexisting agri-food models. The coexistence of conflicting models, such as specialization versus diversification and agro-industrial versus ecological practices, entails power relations that significantly influence the political agenda. Drawing on semi-structured interviews and document analysis, we focus on land-use planning and local food policies to examine how policy integration is shaped by, and reshapes, power relations in the context of coexisting agrifood models in a sample of case studies in France. Our findings show that policy integration occurs with innovative initiatives at the stage where territorial agriculture is assessed, strategies are determined, and policy instruments designed. Integration is, however, constrained by unbalanced power relations, which restrict land-based policy interventions that seek to transform food systems. Local authorities exercise caution when applying these interventions, seeking to involve major farmers? organizations while mitigating contentions. The policy integration process reshapes power relations, empowering alternative minority agri-food professionals through greater influence in the political arena. This process also helps local authorities to acquire legitimacy in agri-food matters. As one of the first studies to offer empirical evidence about land and food policy integration, this article provides insights for policymaking in terms of the crafting of enabling institutional contexts for the transformation of territorial food systems. Future research is suggested to explore contextual influences and power dynamics in policy implementation.";2024;"shift, sustainability, policy, power, integration"

The ongoing research project scClim (https://scclim.ethz.ch/) addresses this demand, uniting complementary expertise to establish a seamless model chain from observing and modeling the weather and climate to the quantification of hail impacts on agriculture, buildings, and cars. In this talk, an overview of the interdisciplinary research project is provided. The project is structured into five strongly interconnected subprojects. Subproject A engages in a close dialogue with key stakeholders to co-design a hail impact assessment platform, incorporating outcomes from the other subproject for practical applications. Subproject B develops an algorithm to track hail cells and applies it to operational weather forecasts and climate simulations to investigate hail cell characteristics. The kilometer-scale convection-permitting climate simulations over Europe are conducted with the regional model COSMO, with the HAILCAST hail growth model embedded. These simulations provide case studies and a 10-year climatology of present-day conditions and a 3?C global warming scenario using a pseudoglobal-warming approach. Subproject C generates a multi-decadal time series of past hailday occurrences in the Swiss radar domain to identify the drivers of inter-annual hail variability and changes in hail seasonality. Additionally, it explores the potential of polarimetric data from the Swiss weather radar network to provide information about the probability and size of hail on the ground. Subprojects D and E construct hail damage models for crops, buildings, and cars to extend the open-source impact modeling platform CLIMADA. The applied vulnerability curves are calibrated with damage data from 2002 to 2021, which was obtained from insurance companies. Ultimately, the developed framework is used to assess the implications of climate change for future hail risks in the addressed sectors.";2024;"hail, climate, risks, impacts, models"

However, forests face significant challenges, such as deforestation, forest degradation, and the impacts of climate change, jeopardizing their long-term sustainability. To tackle these pressing issues, innovative solutions are required, and the internet of things (IoT) emerges as a promising avenue. By leveraging IoT technologies in forest management, also known as the internet of forestry things (IoFT), a transformative approach to forest management can be achieved. The IoFT technology empowers real-time data collection on forest conditions, encompassing parameters like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Additionally, it facilitates monitoring the movement and location of various forest assets, including wildlife, carbon stock, personnel, and equipment. This chapter presents a comprehensive overview of the current state of IoFT technologies and their applications in forest management. The chapter explores the potential benefits of IoFT technology in forest management, highlighting its ability to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, significance, and sustainability of forest ecosystems. It draws upon a collection of studies, reports, and articles to elucidate the various applications of IoFT technologies in forest management. These applications encompass monitoring forest health, predicting and detecting forest fires, and identifying illegal logging activities, among others. IoFT technologies also offer opportunities for optimizing forest operations such as harvesting and transportation while improving the safety of forest workers. However, the chapter also acknowledges the challenges and limitations associated with IoFT technologies in forest management. Concerns over data privacy, security, and interoperability are discussed, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and robust solutions to address these issues. In conclusion, the study provides recommendations for future research endeavors aimed at addressing the challenges and advancing the utilization of IoFT technologies in forest management. By doing so, the potential of IoFT technologies can be harnessed to their fullest extent, paving the way for sustainable and effective forest management practices.";2024;"forests, sustainability, iot, technology, management"

In designated renewal areas, residents/landowners are often subject to several episodes of waiting: waiting for the public authority for information on redevelopment visions; waiting for the plans and projects to become public; waiting for the court ruling if they appeal the plans; waiting for demolition upon plan approvals; and, finally, waiting for the constructions to be completed. Given the complexity of actors and institutions involved in the waiting, it becomes a conflictual political process. This prolonged waiting leads to an ongoing temporariness and precarious spaces of urban renewal. The course of waiting affects the reorganization of the city space ?now? and in the future. We analyze two protracted urban renewal projects from Turkey, Fikirtepe in Istanbul and Karabaglar in Izmir, to explore how residents? decade-long waiting for urban change are shaped and how these diverse waiting experiences lead to different outcomes for the progression of the state-imposed urban renewal agendas. While Karabaglar residents have unified around active bottom-up resistance from the beginning to challenge the project-based plans the central government imposed, Fikirtepe residents pursued individual-level negotiations with developers to maximize private returns following the zoning incentives the public authority gave. Despite the socio-spatial similarities between these designated urban renewal project sites, variances in residents? collective waiting strategies have led to different urban politics around project-based urban change.";2023;"politics, waiting, redevelopment, urban, diversity"

Here we present PISCOt (v1.2), a novel high spatial resolution (0.01?) dataset of daily air temperature for entire Peru (1981-2020). The dataset development involves four main steps: (i) quality control; (ii) gap-filling; (iii) homogenisation of weather stations, and (iv) spatial interpolation using additional data, a revised calculation sequence and an enhanced version control. This improved methodological framework enables capturing complex spatial variability of maximum and minimum air temperature at a more accurate scale compared to other existing datasets (e.g. PISCOt v1.1, ERA5-Land, TerraClimate, CHIRTS). PISCOt performs well with mean absolute errors of 1.4-?C and 1.2-?C for maximum and minimum air temperature, respectively. For the first time, PISCOt v1.2 adequately captures complex climatology at high spatiotemporal resolution and therefore provides a substantial improvement for numerous applications at local-regional level.

Despite its growing success, the adoption as well as the outcomes of organic agriculture remain particularly low in sub-Saharan Africa. In this paper, we propose a multidimensional framework based on farmers' perceived motivations to evaluate the factors enabling or hindering the adoption of organic agriculture, including attitude (the subjective evaluation of a behaviour), ability (the cognitive and technical capacity to perform a behaviour), opportunity (the perceived social, economic, and ecological benefits of a behaviour), and legitimacy (formal and informal values and norms supporting a behaviour). We tested the framework on a sample of around 300 organic and conventional small-scale farmers in a horticultural area in northern Senegal. We found that despite a highly positive attitude towards organic practices among both conventional and organic farmers, adoption remains extremely low, and many have abandoned them. Low perceived ability and a lack of opportunities appeared to be determinant drivers, including difficulties accessing available organic input, knowledge, and tools and lack of both a market and institutional support. Our results suggest that greater emphasis should be placed on creating favourable conditions at the food system level based on broad agroecological principles. This can be achieved, for example, by supporting grassroots farmer organizations, enacting appropriate environmental legislation, securing organic farmers? productive resources, and enhancing participatory organic certification and alternative food networks. Such efforts are likely to have a more significant impact than training and promotion targeting farmers who are already convinced.";2023;"organic, adoption, drivers, africa, farmers"

However, until now, there have been limited studies on the farmers' risk due to pesticide application to fruit crops. The knowledge of farmers' exposure related to pesticide use and their safety practices was studied among 100 banana farmers in three areas (Padampur, Jagatpur, and Thimura) of Chitwan district, Nepal. More than 75% of the farmers complained about problems related to insects. Most frequently used insecticides in the area were chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Ten percent (10%) of the applied pesticides were highly hazardous to humans, according to the World Health Organization hazard category, with skin rash being the most common acute symptom reported by 29% of the farmers. Banned organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, such as endosulfan and triazophos, respectively, are still being used by farmers in the aforementioned areas. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed the lack of knowledge and safety practices among farmers leading to inadequate awareness related to the negative effects of pesticide use on human health and the environment. Therefore, government extension service can play a crucial role in improving banana farmers' knowledge of the toxic effects of pesticides as well as enforcing the Nepali language in the labeling of pesticide containers and packages.";2023;"exposure, pesticides, farmers, banana, safety practices"

Our results show a significant response in flight heights to moonlight illuminance for common and pallid swifts, i.e. when moon illuminance increased flight height also increased, while a moonlight-driven response is absent in alpine swifts. We show a weak relationship between night-time illuminance-driven responses and twilight ascending behaviour, suggesting a decoupling of both crepuscular and night-time behaviour.

Impacted by the demands of distant consumers, the processes of global environmental change and numerous interventions seeking climate, conservation and development goals, these transitions have the potential to impact the relationships and plurality of values held between people and place. This paper is a Synthesis of seven empirical studies within the Special Feature (SF): ?What is lost in transition? Capturing the impacts of conservation and development interventions on relational values and human wellbeing in the tropics?. Through two Open Forum workshops, and critical review, contributing authors explored emergent properties across the papers of the SF. Six core themes were identified and are subsumed within broad categories of: (i) the problem of reconciling scale and complexity, (ii) key challenges to be overcome for more plural understanding of social dimensions of landscape change and (iii) ways forward: the potential of an environmental justice framework, and a practical overview of methods available to do so. The Synthesis interprets disparate fields and complex academic work on relational values, human well-being and de-colonial approaches in impact appraisal. It offers a practical and actionable catalogue of methods for plural valuation in the field, and reflects on their combinations, strengths and weaknesses. The research contribution is policy relevant because it builds the case for why a more plural approach in intervention design and evaluation is essential for achieving more just and sustainable futures, and highlights some of the key actions points deemed necessary to achieve such a transition to conventional practice.";2023;"biocultural, transition, values, tropics, plural"

Quantifying water limitation effects on evapotranspiration (ET) is challenged by the heterogeneity of vegetation types, climate zones and vertically along the rooting zone. Here, we train deep neural networks using flux measurements to study ET responses to progressing drought conditions. We determine a water stress factor (fET) that isolates ET reductions from effects of atmospheric aridity and other covarying drivers. We regress fET against the cumulative water deficit, which reveals the control of whole-column moisture availability. We find a variety of ET responses to water stress. Responses range from rapid declines of fET to 10% of its water-unlimited rate at several savannah and grassland sites, to mild fET reductions in most forests, despite substantial water deficits. Most sensitive responses are found at the most arid and warm sites. A combination of regulation of stomatal and hydraulic conductance and access to belowground water reservoirs, whether in groundwater or deep soil moisture, could explain the different behaviors observed across sites. This variety of responses is not captured by a standard land surface model, likely reflecting simplifications in its representation of belowground water storage.";2023;"accounting, vegetation, drought, evapotranspiration, responses"

The model is entirely forced by the large-scale environment. Downscaling ERA5 reanalysis data shows that the model is generally able to reproduce observed TC climatology, such as the global seasonal cycle, genesis locations, track density, and lifetime maximum intensity distributions. Inter-annual variability in TC count and power-dissipation is also well captured, on both basin-wide and global scales. Regional TC hazard estimated by this model is also analyzed using return period maps and curves. In particular, the model is able to reasonably capture the observed return period curves of landfall intensity in various sub-basins around the globe. The incorporation of an intensity-dependent steering flow is shown to lead to regionally dependent changes in power dissipation and return periods. Advantages and disadvantages of this model, compared to other downscaling models, are also discussed.";2023;"open-source, physics-based, climatology, global, hazard"

Accurately simulating gross primary productivity (GPP) and its seasonality is key for reliable carbon cycle projections. However, significant biases have been found in early spring GPP simulations of northern forests, where observations often suggest a later resumption of photosynthetic activity than predicted by models. Here, we used eddy covariance-based GPP estimates from 39 forest sites that differ by their climate and dominant plant functional types. We used a mechanistic and an empirical light use efficiency (LUE) model to investigate the magnitude and environmental controls of delayed springtime photosynthesis resumption (DSPR) across sites. We found DSPR reduced ecosystem LUE by 30-70% at many, but not all site-years during spring. A significant depression of LUE was found not only in coniferous but also at deciduous forests and was related to combined high radiation and low minimum temperatures. By embedding cold-acclimation effects on LUE that considers the delayed effects of minimum temperatures, initial model bias in simulated springtime GPP was effectively resolved. This provides an approach to improve GPP estimates by considering physiological acclimation and enables more reliable simulations of photosynthesis in northern forests and projections in a warming climate.";2023;"land, carbon, dynamics, ecosystems, photosynthesis"

Therefore, society is confronted with questions about protecting people and assets from flood risks. Key instruments are protective measures, land use regulations, spatial planning, and the interventions by civil protection units if flood magnitudes exceed the protection standards. Both prevention and preparedness require risk awareness from professionals, politicians, and the public. Risk awareness is generally high after an event and low after a period without major events. However, the rarity of extreme flood events limits learning from flood events. The training of intervention forces who should manage flood events with magnitudes beyond hitherto observed flood events requires a comprehensive description and visualization of the flood processes and their impacts. To address this, together with stakeholders and civil protection and intervention planning experts, we co-developed a new way to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of extreme flood events and thereby communicate their impacts using dynamical flood storymaps. We selected physically plausible precipitation scenarios from reforecasts to develop storylines of extreme river flood events and their socioeconomic impacts in Switzerland. The co-development process revealed which information is relevant to potential users and how it must be presented. It is shown that storylines of extreme events presented as storymaps are a valuable tool to communicate scientific results in a way that allows practitioners to gain relevant information for their work. Therefore, we built an interactive online tool (www.flooddynamics.ch), enabling the user to analyze the spatiotemporal unfolding of flood events in Switzerland from the start of precipitation to the recession of the flood. The visualization includes maps of inundated areas at hourly timesteps and the related impacts in terms of affected persons, buildings, roads, and infrastructure. Such a temporally explicit (dynamic) representation of extreme events in storymaps, in contrast to static hazard maps, which are commonly used today, is favorable for emergency intervention planning and training and thus for awareness creation and better disaster preparedness.";2023;"floods, risk, visualization, storymaps, preparedness"

The samples were collected during the 2021 growing season, across 10 study sites, covering the main European crops, and conventional and organic farming systems. We profiled the pesticide residues found in the different matrices using existing hazard classifications towards non-target organisms and humans. Combining monitoring data and hazard information, we developed an indicator for the prioritization of pesticides, which can support policy decisions and sustainable pesticide use transitions. Eighty-six percent of the samples had at least one residue above the respective limit of detection. One hundred residues were found in soil, 112 in water, 99 in sediments, 78 in crops, 76 in outdoor air, and 197 in indoor dust. The number, levels, and profile of residues varied between farming systems. Our results show that non-approved compounds still represent a significant part of environmental cocktails and should be accounted for in monitoring programs and risk assessments. The hazard profiles analysis confirms the dominance of compounds of low-moderate hazard and underscores the high hazard of some approved compounds and recurring ?no data available? situations. Overall, our results support the idea that risk should be assessed in a mixture context, taking environmentally relevant mixtures into consideration. We have uncovered uncertainties and data gaps that should be addressed, as well as the policy implications at the EU approval status level.

To inform conservation planning, in this study we delimited the drainage area of the Gocta waterfall and identified land tenure by applying Geographic Information System (GIS), remote sensing and participatory mapping techniques. Then, by classifying optical, radar and digital elevation models data, we mapped peatland in the jalca of the Gocta drainage area with an overall accuracy of 97.1%. Our results will inform conservation strategy in this complex area of communal, private and informal land tenure systems.

Ecological opportunity is thought to be a prerequisite for adaptive radiation1, but little is known about the relative importance of species' ecological versatility versus effects of arrival order in determining which lineage radiates2. Palaeontological records that could help answer this are scarce. In Lake Victoria, a large adaptive radiation of cichlid fishes evolved in an exceptionally short and recent time interval3. We present a rich continuous fossil record extracted from a series of long sediment cores along an onshore-offshore gradient. We reconstruct the temporal sequence of events in the assembly of the fish community from thousands of tooth fossils. We reveal arrival order, relative abundance and habitat occupation of all major fish lineages in the system. We show that all major taxa arrived simultaneously as soon as the modern lake began to form. There is no evidence of the radiating haplochromine cichlid lineage arriving before others, nor of their numerical dominance upon colonization; therefore, there is no support for ecological priority effects. However, although many taxa colonized the lake early and several became abundant, only cichlids persisted in the new deep and open-water habitats once these emerged. Because these habitat gradients are also known to have played a major role in speciation, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ecological versatility was key to adaptive radiation, not priority by arrival order nor initial numerical dominance.";2023;"adaptive, radiation, ecological, versatility, arrival"

This study aims to establish a storm-relative climatology of three different multivariate hazards in Mediterranean cyclones. Namely, the co-occurrences of rain and wind, rain and wave, and particulate matter and heat are composited relative to storm centers. Composites are computed for various large-scale environments using a recent cyclone classification, which shows that few different large scale configurations lead to each compound event type. Compound rain and wind events are mostly associated with frontal cyclones and cyclones induced by anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking from late fall to early spring in the northern Mediterranean. Compound rain and wave events occur at similar times and locations, but are also associated with cyclonic Rossby wave breaking. Particulate matter and heat compound events are associated with heat lows, daughter cyclones and anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking in the warm season and over North-Africa. Next, we find that the probability of compounding associated with a cyclone class does not depend monotonically on the probabilities of the individual contributing hazards, but also on the goodness of their temporal and spatial correspondence. Finally, we find warm conveyor belts and cold fronts to frequently co-occur with rain and wind, and rain and wave events, while particulate matter and heat events are not strongly associated with dynamical features. These results, which systematically associate various large-scale environments and dynamical features to different compound event types, have implications for forecasting and climate risk predictions.";2023;"cyclones, compound, hazardous, mediterranean, multivariate"

It refers to surface weather or the atmospheric circulation either remaining in approximately the same state (quasi-stationarity) or repeatedly occupying the same state (recurrence) over some prolonged period of time. Persistence can be found at many different timescales; however, sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescales are especially relevant in terms of impacts and atmospheric predictability. For these reasons, S2S persistence has been attracting increasing attention from the scientific community. The dynamics responsible for persistence and their potential evolution under climate change are a notable focus of active research. However, one important challenge facing the community is how to define persistence from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. Despite a general agreement on the concept, many different definitions and perspectives have been proposed over the years, among which it is not always easy to find one's way. The purpose of this review is to present and discuss existing concepts of weather persistence, associated methodologies and physical interpretations. In particular, we call attention to the fact that persistence can be defined as a global or as a local property of a system, with important implications in terms of methods and impacts. We also highlight the importance of timescale and similarity metric selection and illustrate some of the concepts using the example of summertime atmospheric circulation over western Europe.";2023;"meteorology, persistence, timescales, climate change, dynamics"

We provide one of the first comprehensive, simulation-based studies on CC impacts on Alpine Run-of-River (RoR) production, also considering effects of environmental flow requirements and technical increase potential. We simulate future electricity production under three emissions scenarios for 21 Swiss RoR plants with a total production of 5.9 TWh a-1. The simulations show an increase in winter production (4â¯% to 9â¯%) and a decrease in summer production (-2â¯% to -22â¯%), which together lead to an annual decrease of about -2â¯% to -7â¯% by the end of the century. The production loss due to environmental flow requirements is estimated at 3.5â¯% of the annual production; the largest low-elevation RoR power plants show little loss, while small and medium-sized power plants are most affected. The potential for increasing production by optimising the design discharge amounts to 8â¯% of the annual production. The largest increase potential is related to small and medium-sized power plants at high elevations. The key results are: i) there is no linear relationship between CC impacts on streamflow and on RoR production; the impacts depend on the usable streamflow volume, which is influenced by the Flow Duration Curve, environmental flow requirements, and design discharge; ii), the simulated production impacts show a strong correlation ({ensuremath{>";2023;"alpine, production, impacts, climate, river"

Gimeno and Richard Nair";"Ecosystem manipulative experiments are a powerful tool to understand terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change because they measure real responses in real ecosystems and yield insights into causal relationships. However, their scope is limited in space and time due to cost and labour intensity. This makes generalising results from such experiments difficult, which creates a conceptual gap between local-scale process understanding and global-scale future predictions. Recent efforts have seen results from such experiments used in combination with dynamic global vegetation models, most commonly to evaluate model predictions under global change drivers. However, there is much more potential in combining models and experiments. Here, we discuss the value and potential of a workflow for using ecosystem experiments together with process-based models to enhance the potential of both. We suggest that models can be used prior to the start of an experiment to generate hypotheses, identify data needs, and in general guide experimental design. Models, when adequately constrained with observations, can also predict variables which are difficult to measure frequently or at all, and together with the data they can provide a more complete picture of ecosystem states. Finally, models can be used to help generalise the experimental results in space and time, by providing a framework in which process understanding derived from site-level experiments can be incorporated. We also discuss the potential for using manipulative experiments together with models in formalised model?data integration frameworks for parameter estimation and model selection, a path made possible by the increasing number of ecosystem experiments and diverse observation streams.

A comprehensive understanding of the connection between planning and land values is imperative for making well-informed choices regarding the management of land use and spatial development sustainably and responsibly. While instruments of planning law are intensively debated within the planning community, their implicit effects on land values are rarely considered. This study contributes to the field by demonstrating the crucial connection between planning-induced land value changes and value capture instruments in Switzerland. Our analysis shows significant value changes in the planning process. It connects these to redistributive instruments of the Swiss planning regime, which come into play to compensate for disproportionate planning-induced advantages or disadvantages of landowners. Due to the exceptionally significant change in value while zoning, which is present in Switzerland, there are remarkable redistributive instruments - both in terms of value increase (added value capture) and value decrease (compensation). Our study shows that knowledge of planning-related land value changes can help understand redistributive mechanisms, thereby contributing to best-practice debates.";2023;"policy, planning, land values, switzerland, redistribution"

Despite continuously high demand for feed maize, its cultivation has declined unexpectedly over the past decade, pointing to a major land use transition in the uplands. This study investigates the causes of this maize bust and its accompanying land use changes from the perspectives of smallholders. Drawing from fieldwork in the northern province of Nan, we examined their household-level decision-making, challenges, and future visions around land use and livelihoods. Data was collected through a survey of 347 households across 10 villages and semi-structured interviews with 45 smallholders and 8 of their children. We found that many smallholders are being squeezed out of maize because of surging production costs and labor shortages due to aging and the economic out-migration of younger household members. However, rather than abandoning farming altogether, these smallholders are investing in less labor-intensive perennial crops for livelihood security amidst an uncertain future, signaling a pivotal land use transition in the northern uplands. Our data suggests that the ability to make this transition depends on access to land and financial resources. This raises questions around policy support for smallholders with fewer resources who remain dependent on maize despite the growing production risks.";2023;"maize, smallholders, land use, transition, livelihoods"

The vast majority lie outside of protected areas, although relatively few are managed as sacred forests, which limits their access and use. This lack of protection, together with a growing demand for arable land and forest resources, have accentuated their fragmentation, degradation, and deforestation. There is therefore an urgent need to generate knowledge on their social-ecological characteristics and change pressures to support their conservation. This study investigates what are i) the main biophysical and social-ecological characteristics of remnant forest patches, and ii) the potential change pressures and drivers. Within this scope, we apply archetype analysis to discern processes affecting remnant forest patches. Biophysical and socio-ecological indicators were selected from a published dataset via expert consultation, and nine archetypes were developed by applying a cluster analysis. Evaluating the results in relation to ecoregions and landscape features using high resolution imagery, we identify common underlying social-ecological change pressures and characteristics. The most common archetype (2) is characterized by being close to protected areas and having a low average annual precipitation and cluster along the northern fringe of the study area. The second most common archetype (5) is characterized by lying in highly disturbed landscapes, having undergone biomass losses, and widely distributed throughout central and western Nigeria. Patches of archetype 8 found predominantly in mangrove and swamp forests, exhibit positive above-ground biomass changes and greening trends; we propose that these vegetation changes could benefit conservation measures and carbon sequestration programs. In contrast, archetype 10 patches show both forest and biomass losses and gains and are often encompass fragmented forests in urban/arable landscapes. Identifying such common patterns of anthropogenic and ecological change provides a means of prioritizing regionalized strategies for their conservation and sustainable use.";2023;"west africa, forest, patches, conservation, change"

The simulations cover the period from 1420 to 2009. With 60 ensemble members between 1420 and 1850 and 36 ensemble members from 1850 to 2009, ModE-Sim consists of 31 620 simulated years in total. ModE-Sim is suitable for many applications as its various subsets can be used as initial-condition and boundarycondition ensembles to study climate variability. The main intention of this paper is to give a comprehensive description of the experimental setup of ModE-Sim and to provide an evaluation, mainly focusing on the two key variables, 2m temperature and precipitation. We demonstrate ModE-Sim?s ability to represent their mean state, to produce a reasonable response to external forcings, and to sample internal variability. Through the example of heat waves, we show that the ensemble is even capable of capturing certain types of extreme events.";2023;"introduce, ensemble, simulations, evaluation, climate"
"168";"Assessment of subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) ensemble extreme precipitation forecast skill over Europe";"Pauline Marie Cl{'e";"Heavy precipitation can lead to floods and landslides, resulting in widespread damage and significant casualties. Some of its impacts can be mitigated if reliable forecasts and warnings are available. Of particular interest is the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) prediction timescale. The S2S prediction timescale has received increasing attention in the research community because of its importance for many sectors. However, very few forecast skill  assessments of precipitation extremes in S2S forecast data have been conducted. The goal of this article is to assess the forecast skill of rare events, here extreme precipitation, in S2S forecasts, using a metric specifically designed for extremes. We verify extreme precipitation events over Europe in the S2S forecast model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The verification is conducted against ERA5 reanalysis precipitation. Extreme precipitation is defined as daily precipitation accumulations exceeding the seasonal 95th percentile. In addition to the classical Brier score, we use a binary loss index to assess skill. The binary loss index is tailored to assess the skill of rare events. We analyze daily events that are locally and spatially aggregated, as well as 7 d extreme-event counts. Results consistently show a higher skill in winter compared to summer. The regions showing the highest skill are Norway, Portugal and the south of the Alps. Skill increases when aggregating the extremes spatially or temporally. The verification methodology can be adapted and applied to other variables, e.g., temperature extremes or river discharge.";2023;"precipitation, extremes, skill, s2s, forecast"

How this type of plant-soil feedback affects agricultural productivity and food quality in the field in the context of crop rotations is unknown. Here, we assessed the performance, yield and food quality of three winter wheat varieties growing in field plots whose soils had been conditioned by either wild type or benzoxazinoid-deficient bx1 maize mutant plants. Following maize cultivation, we detected benzoxazinoid-dependent chemical and microbial fingerprints in the soil. The benzoxazinoid fingerprint was still visible during wheat growth, but the microbial fingerprint was no longer detected. Wheat emergence, tillering, growth, and biomass increased in wild type conditioned soils compared to bx1 mutant conditioned soils. Weed cover was similar between soil conditioning treatments, but insect herbivore abundance decreased in benzoxazinoid-conditioned soils. Wheat yield was increased by over 4% without a reduction in grain quality in benzoxazinoid-conditioned soils. This improvement was directly associated with increased germination and tillering. Taken together, our experiments provide evidence that soil conditioning by plant secondary metabolite producing plants can increase yield via plant-soil feedbacks under agronomically realistic conditions. If this phenomenon holds true across different soils and environments, optimizing root exudation chemistry could be a powerful, genetically tractable strategy to enhance crop yields without additional inputs.";2023;"plant-soil, feedback, benzoxazinoid, yield, quality"

However, tree-ring proxies often estimate temperatures during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (950-1250 CE) that are similar to, or exceed, those recorded for the past century2,3, in contrast to simulation experiments at regional scales4. This not only calls into question the reliability of models and proxies but also contributes to uncertainty in future climate projections5. Here we show that the current climate of the Fennoscandian Peninsula is substantially warmer than that of the medieval period. This highlights the dominant role of anthropogenic forcing in climate warming even at the regional scale, thereby reconciling inconsistencies between reconstructions and model simulations. We used an annually resolved 1,170-year-long tree-ring record that relies exclusively on tracheid anatomical measurements from Pinus sylvestris trees, providing high-fidelity measurements of instrumental temperature variability during the warm season. We therefore call for the construction of more such millennia-long records to further improve our understanding and reduce uncertainties around historical and future climate change at inter-regional and eventually global scales.";2023;"earth, warming, anomaly, tree-ring, peninsula"

Brennan and Alessandro Hering and J{'e";"Hail is a major threat associated with severe thunderstorms and an estimation of the hail size is important for issuing warnings to the public. Operational radar products exist that estimate the size of the expected hail. For the verification of such products, ground based observations are necessary. Automatic hail sensors, as for example within the Swiss hail network, record the kinetic energy of hailstones and can estimate with this the hail diameters. However, due to the small size of the observational area of these sensors (0.2 m2) the estimation of the hail size distribution (HSD) can have large uncertainties. To overcome this issue, we combine drone-based aerial photogrammetry with a state-of-the-art custom trained deep-learning object detection model to identify hailstones in the images and estimate the HSD in a final step. This approach is applied to photogrammetric image data of hail on the ground from a supercell storm, that crossed central Switzerland from southwest to northeast in the afternoon of June 20, 2021. The hail swath of this intense right-moving supercell was intercepted a few minutes after the passage at a soccer field near Entlebuch (Canton Lucerne, Switzerland) and aerial images of the hail on the ground were taken by a commercial DJI drone, equipped with a 50 megapixels full frame camera system. The average ground sampling distance (GSD) that could be reached was 1.5 mm per pixel, which is set by the mounted camera objective with a focal length of 35 mm and a flight altitude of 12 m above ground. A 2D orthomosaic model of the survey area (750 m2) is created based on 116 captured images during the first drone mapping flight. Hail is then detected by using a region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN). We first characterize the hail sizes based on the individual hail segmentation masks resulting from the model detections and investigate the performance by using manual hail annotations by experts to generate validation and test data sets. The final HSD, composed of 18209 hailstones, is compared with nearby automatic hail sensor observations, the operational weather radar based hail product MESHS (Maximum Expected Severe Hail Size) and some crowdsourced hail reports. Based on the retrieved drone hail data set, a statistical assessment of sampling errors of hail sensors is carried out. Furthermore, five repetitions of the drone-based photogrammetry mission within about 18 min give the unique opportunity to investigate the hail melting process on the ground for this specific supercell hailstorm and location.";2023;"hail, photogrammetry, deep-learning, validation, sensors"

The probability of occurrence and magnitude of pro- and periglacial debris flows is increasing, too, as triggering events such as heavy thunderstorms, long-lasting rainfalls, intense snow melt or rain-on-snow events are likely to occur more often and more intensely in future decades. Hazard assessment for debris flows originating from pro- and periglacial areas is thus crucial but remains challenging, as records of past events on which local magnitude-frequency relationships and debris flow scenarios can be based on are often scarce or inexistent. In this study, we present a multi-methods approach for debris flow hazard scenario building and runout modelling in pro- and periglacial catchments with scarce past event data. Scenario building for the debris flow initiation zone reposes on (i) the definition of meteorological and hydrological triggering scenarios using data on extreme point rainfall and precipitation-runoff modelling, and (ii) the definition of bed load scenarios from empirical approaches and field surveys. Numerical runout modelling and hazard assessment for the resulting debris flow scenarios is carried out using RAMMS-DF, which was calibrated to the studied catchment (Le Dar, western Swiss Alps) based on the area of debris flow deposits from the single major event recorded there in summer 2005. The developed approach is among the first to propose systematic scenario building for pro- and periglacial debris flows triggered by precipitation dependent events.";2023;"debris, flows, hazard, scenario, modelling"

"179";"How observations from automatic hail sensors in Switzerland shed light on local hailfall duration and compare with hailpad measurements";"J{'e";"Measuring the properties of hailstorms is a difficult task due to the rarity and mainly small spatial extent of the events. Especially, hail observations from ground-based time-recording instruments are scarce. We present the first study of extended field observations made by a network of 80 automatic hail sensors from Switzerland. The main benefits of the sensors are the live recording of the hailstone kinetic energy and the precise timing of the impacts. Its potential limitations include a diameter-dependent dead time, which results in less than 5-% of missed impacts, and the possible recording of impacts that are not due to hail, which can be filtered using a radar reflectivity filter. We assess the robustness of the sensors' measurements by doing a statistical comparison of the sensor observations with hailpad observations, and we show that, despite their different measurement approaches, both devices measure the same hail size distributions. We then use the timing information to measure the local duration of hail events, the cumulative time distribution of impacts, and the time of the largest hailstone during a hail event. We find that 75-% of local hailfalls last just a few minutes (from less than 4.4-min to less than 7.7-min, depending on a parameter to delineate the events) and that 75-% of the impacts occur in less than 3.3-min to less than 4.7-min. This time distribution suggests that most hailstones, including the largest, fall during a first phase of high hailstone density, while a few remaining and smaller hailstones fall in a second low-density phase.";2023;"hailstorms, sensors, measurements, impacts, duration"

Apart from social and economic factors contributing to the growing care gap, ageing stands out as a pressing demographic challenge that urges public policy response at all governmental levels. While federal social policies primarily regulate direct/indirect subsidies to make care accessible for those who depend on it, the allocation of space for the delivery and the performance of care remains a spatial planning challenge at the local level. Our central research question concerns the spatial planning instruments and strategies that public authorities use at the local level for the governance of care. We conducted a single case study of Nieuwegein (Netherlands), one of the first Dutch municipalities to formulate a policy combining housing and care by introducing a planning instrument called ?care circles.? Based on the analysis of interviews with planning officials, landowners, and developers, as well as the planning documents and reports, our initial findings demonstrate the prominence of private law contracts between the public authority and for-profit market actors to address the care gap through housing projects. Therefore, implementing policy objectives strongly depends on negotiations between public and private interests. We argue that with the continuous rollback of the state from essential social services, local governments are pushed to act more entrepreneurially to incentivize the provision of elderly housing on an ad-hoc basis. This study demonstrates that socially sustainable urban policy responses to the care gap require deliberate coordination between social policy and land use planning to mitigate the growing care crisis in ageing societies for inclusive and just cities.";2023;"planning, care, gap, spatial, policy"

We measured similar amounts of glyphosate and terbuthylazine in soil whether the herbicides were directly applied to soil or first sprayed on the weed Chenopodium album and we found evidence for more rapid metabolization at high soil moisture. We found that the soil bacterial rather than the fungal community was mainly affected by a single application of the two tested herbicides.

Wirth and Adrian Gilli and Sandro Peduzzi and Martin Grosjean";"Pigments produced by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria are valuable proxies of past anoxia in lacustrine and marine environments. Pigment measurement typically requires time-consuming and costly chemical extractions and chromatographic analyses, which limits the temporal resolution of paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on sedimentary pigments. Here, we evaluate the potential of in situ hyperspectral imaging (HSI) core scanning as a rapid, non-destructive method to document high-resolution changes in oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophic communities at meromictic Lake Cadagno, Switzerland. Three distinct groups of pigments can be detected with the HSI method in the sediments of Lake Cadagno; each pigment group represents a different phototrophic community. Oxygenic phototrophs are indicated by total chloropigments (TChl; chlorophyll a, b, and derivatives). Two types of anoxygenic phototrophs were distinguished ? purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), represented by bacteriochlorophyll a, and green sulfur bacteria (GSB), represented by bacteriochlorophyll c, d, and e. HSI pigment indices were validated by pigment measurements performed on extracted samples using spectrophotometer and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Bacteriochlorophylls were present throughout the past 10 kyr, confirming geochemical evidence of nearly continuous stratification and sulfidic conditions at Lake Cadagno. Major shifts in the anoxygenic phototropic communities are recorded at decadal to millennial scales. GSB and PSB communities coexisted from 10.2?8.8 kyr BP. Dominance of PSB over GSB from 8.8?3.4 kyr BP indicates strongly stratified conditions in the lake and strong light radiation at the chemocline. From 3.4?1.3 kyr BP, PSB were mostly absent, and GSB became dominant, implying lower light intensity at the chemocline due to a combination of factors including deforestation in the lake surroundings, increased flood frequency, cooler climatic conditions, and changes in groundwater solute concentrations. The highresolution HSI data show that frequent flood events and mass movements disturbed the chemocline and the anoxygenic bacterial communities and that the PSB were particularly sensitive and slow to recover following these disturbance events. This study demonstrates for the first time that HSI can detect GSB-related pigments, making the method uniquely valuable as a rapid tool to study samples containing pigments of both oxygenic and anoxygenic phototrophs.";2023;"pigments, imaging, phototrophic, lake, communities"

Pots were prepared with and without maize and in an undisturbed soil, a soil that was disturbed by X-ray sterilization and a soil that was sterilized but reconditioned with the original microbiome. The Zn concentration and isotope fractionation between the soil and the soil pore water increased with time, which is probably due to physical disturbance and fertilization. The presence of maize increased the Zn concentration and isotope fractionation in pore water. This was likely related to the uptake of light isotopes by plants and root exudates that solubilized heavy Zn from the soil. The sterilization disturbance increased the concentration of Zn in the pore water, because of abiotic and biotic changes. Despite a threefold increase in Zn concentration and changes in the Zn isotope composition in the pore water, the Zn content and isotope fractionation in the plant did not change.

Observational studies in the Southern Alps have revealed local supercell \"hotspots\" associated with valleys with large lakes. With a newly developed radar-based, mesocyclone-detection algorithm, the occurrence and evolution of supercell thunderstorms in the Alpine region were characterized. That study highlights the influence of orography on both storm intensity and occurrence frequency. To disentangle the different influential factors, an idealized modeling framework is established using the mesoscale model CM1. In different modeling experiments the key characteristics of this region have been generalized. The modeling scenarios are based on a high-CAPE environment with unidirectional shear, where a warm bubble serves to initiate the convection.  Mimicking the environment of the southern Prealps in central Europe, scenarios with a high mountain ridge, valleys and lakes are explored. Varying both the topographic features and the initial conditions permits the investigation of the individual impact of slopes, valleys and moisture sources. The dynamic and thermodynamic impact of mountain valleys with lakes increases the range of atmospheric conditions that supports supercellular development through horizontal vorticity production and maintenance of high equivalent potential temperature. This influence results in a systematic location dependence of the frequency, intensity and lifetime of supercells, as also found in observations.";2023;"supercell, terrain, orography, modeling, valleys"

While the impacts of certification on well-being are positive for some farmers under certain conditions, they are insignificant or adverse for others. Many barriers can impede positive impacts of certification on well-being. Alternative or complementary strategies such as inclusive business and solidarity economy may challenge these barriers. However, since certification, inclusive business and solidarity economy strategies are studied in isolation, their precise similarities and differences, their interplay and their relative efficacy and limitations remain elusive. Therefore, this paper explores to what extent and how inclusive business and solidarity economy strategies may overcome the persistent governance and economic barriers that limit well-being impacts of certification. We explore four purposively selected cases of inclusive business and solidarity economy strategies from the cacao value chains connecting Peru and Switzerland. Results show that value chain actors combine different specific elements of the three strategies (certification, inclusiveness and solidarity) into portfolios of instruments, which reflect their value chain role and organizational missions. These instrument portfolios may address some of the barriers of certification schemes, but they come with their own challenges and limitations. We conclude that promising future research may use comparative research designs to disentangle specific instruments of inclusiveness, solidarity, and certification; to build typologies of instrument portfolios; to understand their interaction with systemic change in markets and land-use systems; and to specify the conditions under which value chain actors can use specific instruments to improve well-being outcomes of agri-food value chains.";2023;"certification, barriers, strategies, inclusive, well-being"

However, addressing hail damage is challenging, as hail is related to severe thunderstorms, one of the most complex atmospheric phenomena due to its small spatial scale, vigorous development, and intricate physical interactions. In a changing climate, hail frequency and its patterns of occurrence may change, with potentially negative ramifications, e.g. when considering agricultural losses. According to the new Swiss hail climatologies (Madonna et al. 2018; Nisi et al. 2016; Nisi et al. 2020) there is a significant difference between the interannual hail variability on the north and south sides of the Alps. Understanding the drivers of this variability is essential for possible adaptation strategies. In contrast to North America, where important drivers of interannual variability of severe convection are well studied (see Tippett et al. 2015 and Allen et al. 2020), a comprehensive analysis of the year-to-year variability of hail in Switzerland has only been done for the last 20 years (in preparation by Katharina Schr{\"o";2023;"swiss, hail, damage, climate, variability"

This study assessed the impact of precipitation on hospital admissions for mental disorders in Switzerland between 2009-2019. We defined different precipitation events based on the duration (daily precipitation ?1mm for 2, 3, or 4 days; PP.2/PP.3/PP.4) and intensity (?90th percentile for 2 consecutive days; PEP90.2). First, we conducted aggregated time-stratified case-crossover analysis in eight main Swiss cities with distributed lag models to assess the association up to 3 days after the exposure. Then, we pooled the estimates in each city using a multivariate random effects meta-analysis for all hospital admissions and by subgroups (sex, age, diagnosis). Evidence of an association between precipitation and hospital admission for mental disorders was not found in Switzerland (PP.2: 1.003[0.978-1.029]; PP.3: 1.005[0.985-1.026]; PP.4: 0.994[0.960-1.030]; PEP90.2: 1.000[0.953-1.050]).

Rather than adding another theoretical view on the moral relevance of genetic connections, this paper instead proposes an empirically grounded perspective based on two independent qualitative interview-based studies conducted in Belgium and France. Three themes emerge from our empirical data: (1) prioritizing family building; (2) centering the gestational experience of motherhood; and (3) identifying the complexities and limitations of adoption. These themes suggest that the relationship between egg freezing, genetics, biological motherhood, and adoption is highly complex and less straightforward than what is often assumed in the egg freezing debate. Our study provides more detailed insights into women's ambivalent experiences regarding those reproductive options. We discuss the ethical implications of our empirical findings and hold that pursuing genetic desire is not necessarily the main moral reason why women freeze their eggs.";2023;"genetic, ethical, empirical, family, reproduction"

Especially, hail observations from ground-based time-recording instruments are scarce. We present the first study of extended field observations made by a network of 80 automatic hail sensors from Switzerland. The main benefits of the sensors are the live recording of the hailstone kinetic energy and the precise timing of the impacts. Its potential limitations include a diameter dependent dead time which results in less than 5 % of missed impacts, and the possible recording of impacts not due to hail which can be filtered using a radar reflectivity filter. We assess the robustness of the sensors measurements by doing a statistical comparison of the sensor observations with hailpads observations and we show that despite their different measurement approaches, both devices measure the same hail size distributions. We then use the timing information to measure the local duration of hail events, the cumulative time distribution of impacts and the time of the largest hailstone during a hail event. We find that 75 % of local hailfalls last just a few minutes (from less than 4.4 min to less than 7.7 min, depending on a parameter to delineate the events) and that 75 % of impacts occurs in less than 3.3 min to less than 4.7 min. This time distribution suggests that most hailstones, including the largest, fall during a first phase of high hailstone density, while a few remaining and smaller hailstones fall in a second low density phase.";2023;"hailstorm, sensors, observations, timing, distribution"

With a semi-arid climate, it is highly vulnerable to floods driven by extreme precipitation, whose distribution is highly variable in space and time. Yet, this topic has received little attention. The limited availability of data has so far been the major obstacle to pursue such research in Morocco. Public gridded datasets offer good opportunities to overcome this problem. However, the use of such data should be handled with care, especially when applying extreme value theory. The present work aims at addressing this issue. First, we introduce and analyse a comprehensive set of 120 daily precipitation series which we assembled from different stakeholders in Morocco. Then, we perform quality control of the data and use extreme value statistics to infer trends and large return levels. Finally, we assess the accuracy of nine gridded satellite-based and reanalysis daily precipitation datasets using the station data. These results are intended as a first step towards a comprehensive understanding of extreme precipitation in Morocco, and can help select gridded datasets for future hydrometeorological research.";2023;"morocco, precipitation, data, extreme, gridded"

In an effort to reduce this uncertainty, a wide range of global change experiments have been conducted that mimic future conditions in terrestrial ecosystems, manipulating CO2 , temperature, nutrient and water availability. Syntheses of results across experiments provide a more general sense of ecosystem responses to global change, and help to discern the influence of background conditions such as climate and vegetation type in determining global change responses. Several independent syntheses of published data have yielded distinct databases for specific objectives. Such parallel, uncoordinated initiatives carry the risk of producing redundant data collection efforts and have led to contrasting outcomes without clarifying the underlying reason for divergence. These problems could be avoided by creating a publicly available, updatable, curated database. Here, we report on a global effort to collect and curate 57,089 treatment responses across 3,644 manipulation experiments at 1,145 sites, simulating elevated CO2 , warming, nutrient addition and precipitation changes. In the resulting Manipulation Experiments Synthesis Initiative (MESI) database, effects of experimental global change drivers on carbon and nutrient cycles are included, as well as ancillary data such as background climate, vegetation type, treatment magnitude, duration, and, unique to our database, measured soil properties. Our analysis of the database indicates that most experiments are short-term (one or few growing seasons), conducted in the USA, Europe or China, and that the most abundantly reported variable is aboveground biomass. We provide the most comprehensive multifactor global change database to date, enabling the research community to tackle open research questions, vital to global policymaking.

An important driver of these floods is extreme precipitation. Understanding the spatial characteristics of extreme precipitation events is critical to accurately predicting, assessing, and mitigating the risks they pose. Yet, the physical drivers of extreme precipitation events (EPEs) in Morocco remain poorly known. To address this gap, we apply a clustering method to divide Morocco into regions that are spatially consistent in terms of extreme precipitation. We then determine the drivers of extreme precipitation by analyzing atmospheric circulation anomalies during the occurrence of some well chosen EPEs in each region. Our findings suggest that Morocco can be subdivided into 5 spatially coherent regions. Extreme precipitation in the northwestern regions is associated with patterns similar to the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) with strong upper-level flow anomalies enhanced by Greenland blocking and/or Rossby wave breaking (RWB) episodes. By contrast, the southern regions are associated with relatively weak upper air troughs but strong water vapor transport anomalies from the tropics.";2023;"morocco, extreme, precipitation, clusters, circulation"

One way to explore this issue further is to understand the impact on islands after the largest historically observed volcanic eruption: that of Mt Tambora in 1815. For each of the 31 large, populated islands selected, we conducted literature searches for relevant historical and palaeoclimate studies. We also analysed results from a reconstruction (EKF400v2), which uses atmospheric-only general circulation model simulations with assimilated observational and proxy data. From the literature review, there was widespread evidence for weather/climate anomalies in 1815-1817 for these islands (29/29 for those with data). But missing data was an issue for other dimensions such as impaired food production (seen in 8 islands out of only 12 with data). Based on the EKF400v2 reconstruction for temperature anomalies (compared to the relatively \"non-volcanic\" reference period of 1779 to 1808), the islands had lower temperature anomalies in the 1815-1818 period than latitudinally equivalent continental sites (at 100Â km and 1000Â km inland).

Whereas reduction of values (e.g., regulatory takings) are compensated fully, value increments remain to the landowners most often. Scholars and politicians have claimed to introduce an instrument to capture this added value to counterbalance this imbalance. Switzerland is one of the few countries that has actually introduced such an instrument in planning law. National legislators states that planning advantages are to be compensated at a rate of at least 20 per cent of planning related advantages (art. 5 SPA). However, municipalities are granted discretion to shape the instrument by, e.g., defining a capture rate of 50%. The present study aims to understand which contextual factors influence municipalities to use the discretion granted the most. Based on a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of a representative set of 33 municipalities within the Canton of Bern, we examined five contextual factors (political, socio-economical, land managerial, administrative, and financial context) and their influence on the actual implementation of added value capture. Our analysis shows that the professionalism of the local administration has the most substantial influence on the actual shape of the instrument?s implementation.";2023;"planning, land, value, capture, switzerland"

It refers to surface weather or the atmospheric circulation either remaining in approximately the same state (stationarity) or repeatedly occupying the same state (recurrence) over some prolonged period of time. Persistence can be found at many different timescales; however, the sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) timescale is especially relevant in terms of impacts and atmospheric predictability. For these reasons, S2S persistence has been attracting increasing attention by the scientific community. The dynamics responsible for persistence and their potential evolution under climate change are a notable focus of active research. However, one important challenge facing the community is how to define persistence, from both a qualitative and quantitative perspective. Despite a general agreement on the concept, many different definitions and perspectives have been proposed over the years, among which it is not always easy to find one?s way. The purpose of this review is to present and discuss existing concepts of weather persistence, associated methodologies and physical interpretations. In particular, we call attention to the fact that persistence can be defined as a global or as a local property of a system, with important implications in terms of methods but also impacts. We also highlight the importance of timescale and similarity metric selection, and illustrate some of the concepts using the example of summertime atmospheric circulation over Western Europe";2023;"persistence, meteorology, timescales, climate change, dynamics"

Foreign aid is, however, slow and uncertain. Therefore, the Sendai Framework and the Paris Agreement advocate for more resilient financial instruments like sovereign catastrophe risk pools. Existing pools, however, might not fully exploit their financial resilience potential because they were not designed to maximize risk diversification and because they pool risk only regionally. Here we introduce a method that forms pools by maximizing risk diversification and apply it to assess the benefits of global pooling compared to regional pooling. We find that global pooling always provides a higher risk diversification, it better distributes countries? risk shares in the pool?s risk and it increases the number of countries profiting from risk pooling. Optimal global pooling could provide a diversification increase to existing pools of up to 65 %.";2023;"extreme, impact, financial, global, diversification"

In the catchment of Lake Victoria, savanna, rainforest, and Afromontane vegetation have interspersed over the last 17,000 years, which may have influenced the fire regime and vice versa. However, climate and humans are most often the primary drivers of fire regime changes, and analysing their respective roles is critical for understanding current and future fire regimes. Besides a handful of radiocarbon dates on grassy charcoal, the timescales of published studies of Lake Victoria sediment chronologies rely mostly on dates of bulk sediment, and chronological disagreements persist, mainly due to variation between estimations of the 14C reservoir effect. Here, we provide independent 14C chronologies for three Late Glacial and Holocene lacustrine sediment cores from various water depths and compare them with the biostratigraphy to establish a new chronological framework. We present the first continuous sedimentary charcoal records from Lake Victoria; these suggest that fire activity varied substantially during the past 17,000 years. Our new pollen records reveal the long-term vegetation dynamics. The available evidence suggests that before human impact increased during the Iron Age (ca. 2400 yr BP), biomass burning was linked to climate and vegetation reorganizations, such as warming, drying, and the expansion of rainforests and savannas. Our results imply that climate can trigger substantial fire regime changes and that vegetation responses to climate change can co-determine the fire regime. For instance, biomass burning decreased significantly when the rainforest expanded in response to increasing temperatures and moisture availability. Such insights into the long-term linkages between climate, vegetation, and the fire regime may help to refine ecosystem management and conservation strategies in a changing global climate.";2023;"fire, climate, vegetation, chronology, lake"

The instantaneous controls of leaf-level photosynthesis are well established, but there is still no consensus on the mechanisms by which canopy-level GPP depends on spatial and temporal variation in the environment. The standard model of photosynthesis (Farquhar, von Caemmerer, & Berry, 1980) provides a robust mechanistic representation for C3 species, however additional assumptions are required to 'scale up' from leaf to canopy. As a consequence, competing models make inconsistent predictions about how GPP will respond to continuing environmental change. This problem is addressed here by means of an empirical analysis of the light use efficiency (LUE) of GPP inferred from eddy-covariance carbon dioxide flux measurements, in situ measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and remotely sensed estimates of the fraction of PAR (fAPAR) absorbed by the vegetation canopy. Focusing on LUE allows potential drivers of GPP to be separated from its overriding dependence on light. GPP data from over 100 sites, collated over 20-years and located in a range of biomes and climate zones, were extracted from the FLUXNET2015 database and combined with remotely sensed fAPAR data to estimate daily LUE. Daytime air temperature, vapour pressure deficit, diffuse fraction of solar radiation and soil moisture were shown to be salient predictors of LUE in a generalized linear mixed-effects model. The same model design was fitted to site-based LUE estimates generated by 16 terrestrial ecosystem models. The published models showed wide variation in the shape, the strength and even the sign of the environmental effects on modelled LUE. These findings highlight important model deficiencies and suggest a need to progress beyond simple 'goodness of fit' comparisons of inferred and predicted carbon fluxes towards an approach focused on the functional responses of the underlying dependencies.";2023;"production, photosynthesis, environment, light, models"

To address this apparent dilemma, legislators are increasingly relying on densification. However, a fundamental prerequisite (and often a significant challenge) for this is the availability of the land required. Recent planning law reforms in Germany and Switzerland aim to increase the effectiveness and speed at which land is made available for inner development, thus meeting the seemingly conflicting planning policy goals. This paper compares recent legislative efforts in Germany and Switzerland using the comparative law method. The German Building Land Mobilization Act includes amendments to the Building Code (Baugesetzbuch) and the Building Use Ordinance (Baunutzungsverordnung), intended to enable faster activation of building land and the creation of more affordable housing.

However, scientific and policy discourse often overlooks the social processes that influence the equity and effectiveness of restoration interventions. In the present article, we outline how social processes that are critical to restoration equity and effectiveness can be better incorporated in restoration science and policy. Drawing from existing case studies, we show how projects that align with local people's preferences and are implemented through inclusive governance are more likely to lead to improved social, ecological, and environmental outcomes. To underscore the importance of social considerations in restoration, we overlay existing global restoration priority maps, population, and the Human Development Index (HDI) to show that approximately 1.4 billion people, disproportionately belonging to groups with low HDI, live in areas identified by previous studies as being of high restoration priority. We conclude with five action points for science and policy to promote equity-centered restoration.";2023;"ecosystem, equity, social, governance, priority"

Long-term temporal trends towards earlier leaf unfolding are observed across Northern Hemisphere forests. Phenological dates also vary between years, whereby end-of-season (EOS) dates correlate positively with start-of-season (SOS) dates and negatively with growing-season total net CO2 assimilation (Anet). These associations have been interpreted as the effect of a constrained leaf longevity or of premature carbon (C) sink saturation-with far-reaching consequences for long-term phenology projections under climate change and rising CO2. Here, we use multidecadal ground and remote-sensing observations to show that the relationships between Anet and EOS are opposite at the interannual and the decadal time scales. A decadal trend towards later EOS persists in parallel with a trend towards increasing Anet-in spite of the negative Anet-EOS relationship at the interannual scale. This finding is robust against the use of diverse observations and models. Results indicate that acclimation of phenology has enabled plants to transcend a constrained leaf longevity or premature C sink saturation over the course of several decades, leading to a more effective use of available light and a sustained extension of the vegetation CO2 uptake season over time.";2023;"leaf, phenology, net, co2, longevity"

How the rooting-zone water-storage capacity varies spatially is largely unknown and not directly observable. Here we estimate rooting-zone water-storage capacity globally from the relationship between remotely sensed vegetation activity, measured by combining evapotranspiration, sun-induced fluorescence and radiation estimates, and the cumulative water deficit calculated from daily time series of precipitation and evapotranspiration. Our findings indicate plant-available water stores that exceed the storage capacity of 2-m-deep soils across 37% of Earth's vegetated surface. We find that biome-level variations of rooting-zone water-storage capacities correlate with observed rooting-zone depth distributions and reflect the influence of hydroclimate, as measured by the magnitude of annual cumulative water-deficit extremes. Smaller-scale variations are linked to topography and land use. Our findings document large spatial variations in the effective root-zone water-storage capacity and illustrate a tight link among the climatology of water deficits, rooting depth of vegetation and its sensitivity to water stress.";2023;"rooting, water-storage, capacity, spatially, global"

We conducted two series of five in situ infiltration experiments each on undisturbed forest and grassland soil of contrasting bulk densities and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and one on six soil columns with mineral soil and various textures without structure. Finally, we measured Ks, saturated water content and the van Genuchten parameters of these soils. Based on the obtained results, we found the best correlations to be exponential correlations between clay content and infiltrated water volume on the one hand and between clay content and the hydraulic properties on the other hand in all cases. Considering the infiltrated volume obtained by the infiltrometer and the measured soil parameters in mineral soil columns as references, we hypothesized that any change in hydraulic parameters of the natural soil is proportional to the change in infiltration volume. Thus, a second term accounting for water volume changes was therefore included in the correlation equations. The first validations of Ks values in forest soil showed good agreement with the laboratory measurements. Further investigations are needed to extend our validation to other soils with various textures.";2023;"infiltrometer, soil, structure, correlation, hydraulic"

Heredia Bari{'o";"The timing and impact of deglaciation and Holocene readvances on the terrestrial continental margins of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) have been well-studied but are still debated. Potter Peninsula on King George Island (KGI) (Isla 25 de Mayo), South Shetland Islands (SSI), NW Antarctic Peninsula, has a detailed assemblage of glacial landforms and stratigraphic exposures for constraining deglacial landscape development and glacier readvances. We undertook new morphostratigraphic mapping of the deglaciated foreland of the Warszawa Icefield, an outlet of the Bellingshausen (Collins) Ice Cap on Potter Peninsula, using satellite imagery and new lithofacies recognition and interpretations, combined with new chronostratigraphic analysis of stratigraphic sections, lake sediments, and moraine deposits. Results show that the deglaciation on Potter Peninsula began before c. 8.2 ka. Around c. 7.0 ka, the Warszawa Icefield and the marine-facing Fourcade Glacier readvanced across Potter Peninsula and to the outer part of Potter Cove. Evidence of further readvances on Potter Peninsula was absent until the  Warszawa Icefield margin was landward of its present position on three occasions: c. 1.7?1.4 ka, after c. 0.7 ka (most likely c. 0.5?0.1 ka), and by 1956 CE. The timing of Holocene deglaciation and glacier fluctuations on Potter Peninsula are broadly coeval with other glacier- and ice-free areas on the SSI and the northern AP and likely driven by interactions between millennial?centennial-scale changes in solar insolation and irradiance, the southern westerlies, and the Southern Annular Mode.";2023;"deglaciation, readvances, holocene, peninsula, antarctic"
"261";"Imagining motherhood and becoming a mother after egg freezing. An anthropological study in the French context";"Yolinliztli Perez Hernandez";"This paper examines how women accessing social egg freezing (SEF), medical egg freezing (MEF), and egg sharing (ESH) imagine becoming a mother (normative motherhood) in contrast to how they become a mother (reproductive trajectory). It uses data collection from 43 semi-structured in-depth interviews with French women who have had their eggs cryopreserved in France and abroad, five of whom have had children. It was found that most of the women interviewed associate motherhood with heterosexual coupledom, the nuclear family, and a normalized desire for biogenetic motherhood. Nevertheless, ontological disruptions caused by infertility, singlehood, or illness introduce the possibility that they will be unable to have children as expected, which leads them to imagine (and consider) both medical and non-medical ways of having a child. Women?s narrations of alternative paths toward motherhood describe a fragmentation of motherhood into genetic, biological, and social components, which are combined and hierarchized in unexpected ways. I argue that, although alternative reproductive trajectories might modify the kinship ties between the parties involved, they do not necessarily defy normative motherhood. To my knowledge, this is the first empirical study conducted among French women undertaking egg freezing. It seeks to contribute to a growing corpus of empirical research that analyzes egg freezing and its links with motherhood. Second, it mobilizes an innovative approach by examining similarities between SEF, MEF, and ESH. Furthermore, it proposes that women who freeze their eggs for medical reasons or in exchange for an egg donation also inscribe their egg freezing procedure within a heteronormative, biogenetic ideal of motherhood, and a normalized desire for a nuclear family. Finally, it contributes to analyzing the decision-making processes of women who become a mother after egg freezing.";2023;"motherhood, egg freezing, reproduction, normative, heteronormative"

Their spatial extent is seldom taken into account, or only based on case studies. Yet, the spatial dependence in prolonged warm or cold anomalies is critical to correctly understand the associated risks, whether in present-day or future climates. Here, we present a regionalisation of 3-week warm and cold spells in winter and summer across the Northern Hemisphere based on their sensitivity to the large-scale circulation. We identify spatially coherent regions and discuss the physical drivers responsible for persistent extreme temperature anomalies. Blocks are important precursors of such events ? co-localized blocks for persistent summer warm spells and upstream blocks for winter cold spells. Recurrent Rossby wave patterns are also relevant for many mid-latitude regions. Additionally, summer warm spells are ? unsurprisingly ? often accompanied by negative precipitation anomalies that likely play an important role through land-atmosphere feedbacks";2023;"mortality, crop, power, grid, temperature"

A typical response has been land abandonment. The focus of this paper is on the farming systems of the Greek islands of Lesvos and Lemnos. These neighboring islands are geographically very similar but differ greatly in their farming systems, resulting in different responses to the same megatrends. While land abandonment is widespread in the small-scale olive groves of Lesvos, on Lemnos specialization towards animal and dairy products is more common. We performed land cover analysis and interviews with farmers in both areas, in two complementing rounds: one more quantitative that recorded recent changes and farmer rationales and a more qualitative one that investigated longer term trends and decision-making patterns. The analysis revealed that, among others, land ownership and inheritance patterns matter in both areas in different ways, leading to diverse trajectories. On Lemnos, as part of the traditional mixed-farming system (Mandra), land leasing is dominant, separating land users and landowners. Interviews also reveal the different symbolic capital, as olive trees on Lesvos are considered a family asset and not just a land use, something that cannot be said of the leased grazing lands on Lemnos. The market value of the different products is important, but the different trajectories also demonstrate how the rationales behind the responses to mega-trends can guide which trajectories will be dominant in the area. This article highlights the complexity and mix of local drivers and global trends that drive abandonment at both farm and the landscape scales and guides the formulation and application of agricultural policies and public resources for improved management of marginal areas.";2023;"farming, challenges, responses, land, abandonment"

Ogunsumi and Olugbenga Egbetokun and Chinwe Ifejika Speranza";"Earth observation approaches for large-scale crop monocultures are often not transferable to heterogeneous smallholder systems. Key challenges in this regard are intercropping, high intra-field crop type variability, wide sowing windows, presence of non-crop vegetation and small but variable field sizes. Currently, studies on smallholder agriculture mainly focus on specific crops and seldom account for crop mixtures or multiple growing cycles. Moreover, our knowledge about ongoing processes of farm consolidation and effects on intercropping remains limited due to the absence of spatially detailed information on field size. We mapped monocropping and maize-cassava intercropping in 2022/2023 and the relationship with field sizes. We combined Sentinel-1 radar and optical Sentinel-2 time series to classify farming systems across two growing cycles in the Guinea Savannah of southwest Nigeria. We tested spectral-temporal features at monthly and bimonthly intervals for the growing season and off-season. We used deep transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained convolutional neural network designed for crop field delineation. Using very high resolution imagery (0.6 m) for a regularly distributed sample across the study region (n=2,333), mean overall accuracy based on k-fold cross-validation was 0.79 (+/-0.02%), whereas User and Producer accuracies were above 0.70 for most classes. Sentinel-1 alone underperformed, while models using only Sentinel-2 had higher overall accuracies but suffered from cloud-induced data gaps. Field size estimation revealed a high spatial agreement with mean intersection over union scores of up to 0.73 in site-level field size estimation. Small and medium-sized fields were dominant. Monocropping was positively related to field sizes as larger monocropping fields of early-planted cassava, late-planted maize, yam and rice clustered in the North of our study region. In contrast, smaller intercropped fields of maize-cassava mainly occurred in fragmented agricultural landscapes with ample natural vegetation. Our approach demonstrates the potential of integrating radar and optical time series in cloud-prone regions for mapping crop mixtures in complex forest-agricultural mosaic landscapes during multiple growing cycles. Our study provides a valuable workflow for producing timely information for the quantification of crop production in heterogeneous smallholder farming systems.";2023;"earth, observation, smallholder, crop, intercropping"

In this work, we identified and selected frameworks that simulate SOM pools and stocks as well as the effects of different management practices. We also required that the frameworks be easily accessible for farm-related end users and require limited and accessible amounts of input data. In all, six frameworks met our inclusion criteria: SOCRATES (Soil Organic Carbon Reserves and Transformations in EcoSystems), CCB (CANDY and-Carbon Balance), AMG, CENTURY, CQESTR, and RothC (Rothamsted Carbon Model). We collected information on these frameworks and compared them in terms of their accessibility, the model time steps used, the nutrient cycles included in the simulation, the number of SOM pools, and the agricultural management options included.

As a result, housing developments increasingly take place within the existing housing stock through soft densification in the form of subdivisions. Municipalities aim to regulate this type of densification because of growing pressure on existing infrastructure, neighborhood cohesion, and (rental) prices. This contribution looks at the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands as a case study, where small-scale private investors increasingly bought up owner-occupied homes to subdivide into rental homes. As a result, the executive council of the municipality introduced new subdivision regulations in 2016. It explores how the interests of the investors influenced the negotiations that took place during the policy formulation and implementation phases. Using a neo-institutionalist approach, we found that policy negotiations gave rise to an increased number of flexible rules on subdivisions, allowing municipal authorities to make decisions on a case-by-case basis. While official subdivisions have reduced drastically as a result of the new policy, investors have moved towards other less regulated opportunities or even illegal subdivisions. These findings highlight that while flexible implementation may provide more steering capacity for municipalities, it may also lead to non-compliance as an unexpected byproduct.";2023;"urban sprawl, housing market, densification, municipal regulations, investors"

The respective monthly temperature series were published over 60 years ago and are part of todays main global temperature data sets. After digitizing the raw sub-daily measurements, we rebuilt the early instrumental part (i.e., before 1864) of the two series at daily resolution using modern methods and additional data sources that were not considered in previous efforts. A comparison with the old series and with other existing recontructions show a generally good agreement only for the last 30 years. Before the 1830s a few systematic differences appear, particularly in summer, suggesting that both new and old versions contain residual inhomogeneities. We use the new series together with other reconstructions to analyze the periods 1791?1807 and 1808?1824, which have been described, respectively, as a warm and cold period in summer in previous studies. Our results suggest that most existing instrumental data sets tend to overestimate summer temperature in Switzerland during the former period, confirming previous results based on proxy records. The overestimation is particularly large (almost 1 ?C) in the old Geneva series. On the other hand, we find a probable systematic underestimation of summer temperature in our Basel series. Before the 1780s the agreement between existing reconstructions is poor, so that it is hardly possible to make confident statements about climate variability for the first few decades covered by the series. Nevertheless, the daily resolution of the data allows an insight into individual meteorological events such as cold spells and heat waves.";2023;"basel, geneva, temperature, reconstruction, agreement"

The implementation of this goal is acknowledged to come with a range of benefits such as biodiversity preservation, improved energy efficiency, and optimising infrastructure costs. While the need for densification is largely undisputed in the planning debate, the question remains, however, of how to achieve this policy objective. Planning practice is struggling with the implementation of densification objectives because the process implies that stakeholders must deal with the existing built environment, small-scale ownership structures, mosaic of ways, etc. In this paper, we discuss four theses that help explain these implementation difficulties. We take the Swiss spatial planning policy system as a case study example due to its traditionally high priority of densification implementation in Swiss cantons and municipalities. Our four theses suggest different intervention approaches at the federal, cantonal, and local levels to steer and implement densification goals effectively. As well as a clear definition of what ?densification? means (and what not), greater financial and personnel support is regarded as being key for municipal planning administrations to effectively resist increasingly professional and legally powerful landowners.";2023;"densification, benefits, implementation, stakeholders, planning"

Today, 33 countries operate 442 nuclear power reactors, and nine countries possess nearly 13,000 nuclear arms. The result is high-level waste that is dangerously radioactive for millennia to come. Yet, there has never been a permanent waste solution in place. Technically feasible long-term nuclear waste storage options exist, but nearly all governments prefer riskier interim plans hidden from public view and debate. This chapter considers the likelihood of societies addressing the contentious environmental and economic politics of deep geological repositories; and it asks, how long will obfuscation of the risks of this unique Anthropocene challenge continue?";2023;"nuclear, waste, storage, risk, obfuscation"

Yet, the effects of biogeochemical weathering factors occurring in the soil environment are unknown. As the transport, fate, and toxicity of MP and NP depend directly on their surface properties, it is crucial to characterize their transformation in soils to better predict their impact and interactions in this environment. Here, we used scanning transmission x-ray micro spectroscopy to characterize depth profiles of the surface alteration of environmental plastic debris retrieved from soil samples. Controlled weathering experiments in soil and with UV radiation were also performed to investigate the individual effect of these weathering factors on polymer surface alteration. The results revealed a weathered surface on a depth varying between 1 ?m and 100 nm in PS, PET and PP environmental plastic fragments naturally weathered in soil. Moreover, the initial step of surface fragmentation was observed on a PS fragment, providing an insight on the factors and processes leading to the release of MP and NP in soils. The comparison of environmental, soil incubated (for 1 year) and UV weathered samples showed that the treatments led to different surface chemical modifications. While the environmental samples showed evidence of alteration involving oxidation processes, the UV weathered samples did not reveal oxidation signs at the surface but only decrease in peak intensities (indicating decrease of the number of chemical C bonds). After a one-year incubation of samples in soil no clear aging effects were observed, indicating that the aging of polymers can be slow in soils.

The mobility, bioavailability and toxicity of As are determined by its concentration and speciation. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to study the effects of soil microbial disturbance and maize plants on arsenic concentration and speciation in soil (pore) water and soils. Three soil treatments with varying microbial disturbance were designed for this experiment: native soil, sterilized soil and sterilized soil reconditioned with soil indigenous microbes. The three soil treatments were intersected with three levels of As in soils (0, 100 and 200 mg kg?1 spiked As). Ten pots of each treatment were planted with maize, while three pots were filled with soil without maize. The difference between native and reconditioned soil indicated the abiotic sterilization effect (artifact of the sterilization process), while the difference between sterilized and reconditioned soil showed the microbial disturbance effect. Both effects increased As release into soil water. The microbial disturbance effect was more pronounced for organic As species, showing the influence of soil microbes involved in As methylation. The abiotic sterilization effect was more evident in unplanted pots than planted pots and the microbial disturbance effect was observed only in unplanted pots, suggesting that both effects were mitigated by the presence of maize.";2023;"arsenic, concentration, speciation, soil, maize"

We analysed Swiss stakeholders? perceptions of the effects of WTRs and their support for measures to implement them. It is assumed that public support will play a significant role in putting WTRs into practice.  There is some scientific evidence that work time reductions (WTRs) have beneficial ecological, social, and economic effects that could contribute to a transition to a post-growth society. However, little research has been conducted on whether the occurrence of such desired effects is acknowledged: Do they form part of the public debate and is there any public support for WTRs? We conducted a two-round survey among Swiss stakeholder groups (N = 51/28) to identify what effects they believe WTRs have, and what measures to implement WTRs they would be most likely to support. Stakeholders perceived WTRs to have several beneficial social and economic effects, including effects that are relevant for a transition to a post-growth society. However, they did not assume that ecological effects occur. Measures voluntarily implemented on an organisational level by businesses were more popular than those implemented on a national policy or social partnership level. Certain incremental measures and/or those that are merely conducive to WTRs were uncontested. Other more direct and extensive measures were predominantly supported, but not uncontested.";2023;"effects, stakeholders, transition, support, measures"

Using aerial images and a classification scheme with functional and morphological attributes, the study shows that the majority of discount stores were built in peripheral commercial areas or greenfield sites as solitary buildings, indicating a preference for minimal land acquisition costs and car orientation. Some integrated central locations were also chosen. The average density measured by floor area ratio was low. The results suggest that without planning intervention, private actors? decisions would lead to sprawled settlement patterns with high ecological and societal costs.

However, its use and application remain below potential on the continent. This article examines how EO can better serve the needs of African users. First, we argue that a successful uptake of EO services is conditional on understanding the African context and matching EO development and deployment to it. Using reference cases, we find that actors outside Africa drive most EO initiatives, whereas country-level expenditures on EO remain low. Recent developments, such as the African space policy and strategy, and initiatives in partnerships with Africa-based organisations to develop a community of practice on EO hold the potential to fill the identified gaps. The analysis indicates that most EO users are either government organisations or researchers, with very few cases involving other types of users. It is generally assumed that users at the local levels are educated and digitally literate, or that the transmission of EO-based knowledge is achieved by government officers and researchers. Although still very few, potentials are emerging for the private sector to deploy EO products and services such as crop or index-based insurance directly to farmers. These private initiatives have prospects for further developing indigenous EO capacity as envisioned in the African space policy and strategy. We then formulate recommendations for a transdisciplinary approach that integrates user contexts, attributes and needs to enhance the uptake of EO products and services in Africa. We conclude by proposing actions to close some of the identified gaps and seize emerging opportunities.

RAA helps shape the local food system, which is an increasingly studied topic in the planning field. However, institutional impacts on planning approaches for RAA remain unknown. This study examines this question by comparing land-use and food planning in Dutch and French cases, where France defines food planning via national law and the Netherlands does not. Through analysis of planning documents and semi-structured interviews, we identified planning goals and instruments, and analysed governance models. We then linked these three components to understand institutional impacts. Our empirical findings reveal that regarding planning policies on RAA, there are differences between the two countries in terms of focused action fields, planning instruments, and links between land-use and food planning. Our results show that the dominance of state-local relationships in France and civil society-government relationships in the Netherlands has a significant effect on planning approaches. This study supports the need for an emphasis on institutional design for effective planning for RAA.";2023;"reterritorialisation, agricultural, activities, local, planning"

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding the actual implementation of such programs and their potential to empower smallholders, especially in the West African region. Drawing on co-produced knowledge from anthropological fieldwork in Western Senegal, the case study of an alternative food network explores the interlinkages between the promotion of agroecology, anti-migration policies, and unequal power and market relations. Informed by decolonial political ecologies, the analysis reveals different layers of coloniality which complicate embodied effects on horticultural smallholders. The authors conclude that instead of fostering the emancipation of smallholders, development actors promote a labor-intensive and unprofitable way of farming that exploits local resources for the sake of green agendas and white markets. This article highlights the need for a critical reflection on the potential limitations of agroecology and calls for a more nuanced approach that considers the complex realities of smallholders in West Africa.";2023;"agroecology, smallholders, power, coloniality, limitations"

Through a series of oral history interviews with survivors of the 2003 Canberra firestorm in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), this paper investigates ruined homes as spaces imbued with memory ? of the fire itself, of life before the fires, and of a once imagined future. By examining the first hours and days after the firestorm, we explore the complex temporalities and spatial meanings at play in spaces that are simultaneously understood as both home and ruins. We argue that the unmaking of home by fire is a gradual process. In resistance to the rapid destruction of fire, and before the clearing of ruins by demolition crews, many firestorm survivors enact a slow and embodied process of unmaking. This enactment allows both a coming to terms with the fire?s material impacts and a careful engagement with the space?s mnemonic resonances. It provides important lessons for a 21st century where more frequent and intense disasters will continue to result in engagement with home-in-ruins.";2023;"firestorm, ruins, memory, home, survivors"

A farmers' perspective on the development since the 1960s.";"Franziska Mohr and Vasco Diogo and Julian Helfenstein and Niels Debonne and Thymios Dimopoulos and Wenche Dramstad and Maria Garc{'i";"UNLABELLED  Farming in Europe has been the scene of several important socio-economic and environmental developments and crises throughout the last century. Therefore, an understanding of the historical driving forces of farm change helps identifying potentials for navigating future pathways of agricultural development. However, long-term driving forces have so far been studied, e.g. in anecdotal local case studies or in systematic literature reviews, which often lack context dependency. In this study, we bridged local and continental scales by conducting 123 oral history interviews (OHIs) with elderly farmers across 13 study sites in 10 European countries. We applied a driving forces framework to systematically analyse the OHIs. We find that the most prevalent driving forces were the introduction of new technologies, developments in agricultural markets that pushed farmers for farm size enlargement and technological optimisation, agricultural policies, but also cultural aspects such as cooperation and intergenerational arrangements. However, we find considerable heterogeneity in the specific influence of individual driving forces across the study sites, implying that generic assumptions about the dynamics and impacts of European agricultural change drivers hold limited explanatory power on the local scale. Our results suggest that site-specific factors and their historical development will need to be considered when addressing the future of agriculture in Europe in a scientific or policy context.

The policy complexity of the third generation of innovation policy (TGIP), however, puts less-developed European regions at risk of being left behind from this novel policy paradigm due to lower institutional and governance capacities. Building on the concept of a small wins strategy that focuses on small-scale and bottom-up initiatives that are guided by a shared mission to address wicked problems, the article?s methodology uses expert interviews, examples of challenge prizes, and desk research to explore whether inducement prizes can potentially engage less-developed regions (LDRs) in TGIP to address place-based societal challenges through a small wins strategy. The article introduces the concept of a challenge-oriented regional prize (CORP) as a stepping-stone policy tool to engage LDRs in TGIP through a small wins strategy, namely regarding issues of directionality, legitimacy, responsibility, and strategic orientation. CORPs are, however, not a silver bullet policy tool for LDRs to engage in TGIPs due to their design and implementation constraints.";2023;"innovation, policy, small, regions, challenges"

However, whether these behavioural responses to human pressure are consistent among key functional groups has been poorly studied. For example, while mammal species tend to become more nocturnal in areas with high human pressure, it is unclear if co-occurring birds display similar or opposite patterns. Here we used information from camera trapping (367 camera stations and 16,939 camera/days) along a gradient of human pressure in the Colombian Llanos to assess diel activity changes in understory birds and mammals. We found that diel activity significantly changed with higher human pressure for 45% of the birds (five species) and 36% of the mammals (five species) assessed, with four of five birds becoming more diurnal and all five mammals becoming more nocturnal. The average increase in nocturnality for the mammals was 11.3% while the average increase in diurnality for the birds was 7%. There was high variation in body size and dietary guild within impacted species, and only some were directly persecuted or hunted, suggesting that there are different pathways through which human pressure can affect vertebrates? activity patterns. The contrasting behavioural responses to humans among vertebrate functional groups has significant repercussions for the fields of community ecology, including intraguild predation and competition, and should be a significant ecosystem-level conservation consideration.";2023;"human, pressure, activity, patterns, mammals"

However, hydropower is itself dependent on local weather conditions and climate variability. Moreover, extreme climate conditions, such as hot-dry compound events, can have a major impact on hydropower production (HP). Here, we examine the impacts of hot-dry conditions on HP under current and future climate scenarios in Switzerland, a country where hydropower provides the biggest share (60%) of the total electricity production. Overall, our results point out that the impacts of hot-dry conditions on HP are case-specific. We found that hot-dry compound conditions during the warmer months negatively impact HP in power plants with little or no water storage capacity (run-of-river schemes). On the contrary, schemes with large, seasonal accumulation lakes and significant glacier resources will continue to be able to produce high amounts of HP during hot-dry conditions in summer, which is an important result for Alpine hydropower.";2023;"hydropower, climate, impact, production, switzerland"

Hamouda and Claudia Pasquero";"Central Asian orography (namely the Tibetan and Mongolian plateaux) sets important features of the winter climate over eastern Asia and the Pacific. By deflecting the mid-latitude jet polewards it contributes to the formation of the Siberian high and, on the lee side, to the advection of dry cold continental air over the eastern Asian coast and the Pacific Ocean, where atmospheric instability and cyclogenesis thrive. While the mechanic forcing by the orography is assessed in a number of modelling studies, it is still not clear how near-surface temperature over the two most prominent orographic barriers of the central Asian continent ? the Tibetan and Mongolian plateaux ? influences the winter climate. The problem is particularly relevant in view of a well-known cold bias in state-of-the-art climate models in proximity to the Tibetan Plateau, likely related to the modelling of land processes and land?atmosphere interaction over complex orography. Here we take advantage of the large spread in near-surface temperature over the central Asian plateaux within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to study how colder-than-average Asian plateau temperatures impact the atmospheric circulation. Based on composites of the CMIP6 models' climatologies showing the coldest Tibetan Plateau conditions, we find that such negative temperature anomalies appear to amplify the atmospheric response to orography, with an intensification of the eastern Asian winter monsoon and of the equatorward flank of the Pacific jet. The results of the CMIP6 composite analysis are supported by experiments run with an intermediate-complexity atmospheric model, forced by a similar pattern of cold surface temperatures over the central Asian plateaux. Within this setting, the relative influence of the Tibetan and the Mongolian Plateau surface conditions is analysed. Based on the results reported in this work we project that advances in the modelling of the land energy budget over the elevated regions of central Asia could improve the simulation of the climate in the Asian?Pacific sector climate, together with the reliability of climate projections and the performance of shorter-term forecasts.";2023;"tibetan, mongolian, winter, climate, plateau"

Social innovations can help mountain regions solve local challenges by creating novel ideas to improve the situation. This, in turn, can have various effects on the mountain economy. However, there is still no consensus on the ways in which social innovations create economic impulses such as economic growth or even economic growth independence. This article aims to improve our understanding of social innovations and their impact on the local mountain economy. We examine the 100% Valposchiavo initiative, which aims to close regional value chains by bringing together economic actors in agriculture, production, and hospitality in a Swiss mountain region. In particular, the article examines the evolution of the initiative and its impact on local SMEs. We employed the novel method of innovation biographies and conducted narrative and guided interviews to examine the ways in which the initiative evolved and what its effects are on participating SMEs. The results show that 100% Valposchiavo induced potential growth effects through its focus on increased collaboration, whereas (re)localization created growth-independent effects. Some companies are growth dependent because of higher demand, junior management, modernization efforts, or a fastgrowing market. The growth-independent companies pursue this strategy through personal contacts, their corporate philosophy, their management age, or their business form.

Here we analyze, for the first time, the state of evidence that ecological quality, in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem functions, impacts the quality of Coffea arabica and C. canephora, based on 78 studies. The following ecosystem functions were included: pollination; weed, disease, and pest control; water and soil fertility regulation. Biodiversity was described by the presence, percentage, and diversity of shade trees. Coffee quality was described by the green bean physical characteristics, biochemical compounds, and organoleptic characteristics. The presence and diversity of shade trees positively impacted bean size and weight and reduced the percentage of rejected beans, but these observations were not consistent over different altitudes. In fact, little is known about the diversity of shade trees and their influence on biochemical compounds. All biochemical compounds varied with the presence of shade, percentage of shade, and elevation. Coffee beans from more diverse tree shade plantations obtained higher scores for final total organoleptic quality than simplified tree shade and unshaded plantations. Decreasing ecological quality diminished ecosystem functions such as pollination, which in turn negatively affected bean quality. Shade affected pests and diseases in different ways, but weeds were reduced. High soil quality positively affected coffee quality. Shade improved the water use efficiency, such that coffee plants were not water stressed and coffee quality was improved. While knowledge on the influence of shade trees on overall coffee quality remains scarce, there is evidence that agroecosystem simplification is negatively correlated with coffee quality. Given global concerns about biodiversity and habitat loss, we recommend that the overall definition of coffee quality include measures of ecological quality, although these aspects are not always detectable in certain coffee quality characteristics or the final cup.";2023;"ecological quality, coffee, biodiversity, shade, quality"
"347";"How does co-creation influence healthcare regulationsâ¯? An analysis of co-creation in social innovation";"Pascal Tschumi and Heike Mayer";"Social innovations are discussed as solutions to societal challenges, such as ensuring quality healthcare provision. Co-creation (i.e. the collaboration of actors who share their knowledge and skills), a primary feature of social innovation, can play a central role in changing formal institutions such as regulations, which is crucial to solving challenges in highly regulated sectors such as healthcare. However, research investigating how co-creation in social innovation can influence regulations is lacking. We investigate how co-creation can affect the ways social innovation actors influence healthcare regulations by analysing three social innovations in the Bernese Oberland, a Swiss mountain region facing the challenge of maintaining quality healthcare provision. Applying innovation biographies and semi-structured interviews, we find that two co-creating actor types were involved in influencing regulations: social innovation leaders and actors who fulfil central social innovation tasks. They influenced regulations by suggesting changes and inducing others to implement them, and they learned knowledge and skills in co-creation that helped them perform these activities. However, resources unrelated to co-creation also helped them influence regulations, such as actor networks and skills in persuading others. Co-creation in social innovation can thus support institutional change but is not a guarantee for it.";2023;"social, innovation, regulations, healthcare, co-creation"

Agency in social innovations can create new resources and capacities for transformative change in a region. To date, there is a lack of empirical studies investigating how agency manifests itself in social innovations. In particular, research has not yet investigated the detailed activities of social innovation actors throughout the phases of social innovation processes. In this paper we apply the concept of trinity of change agency to investigate the activities of social innovation actors. Using innovation biographies and data from 61 interviews for 11 case studies of social innovation in a peripheral mountain region in Switzerland, we analyse the social innovation process from an actor-oriented perspective. Our findings show that the various types of change agency are highly present in social innovations. The significance of change agency alters throughout the innovation process. Our analysis shows that all kinds of actors performed change agency during the social innovation process. Interestingly, same actors performed different types of change agency during the social innovation process. The findings suggest that change agency is as a significant element in social innovations and that we need to consider it as a transformative element of social innovation processes. When policymakers take change agency into account in creating an environment in which social innovations can flourish, there is a great chance that social innovations can contribute to changing regional development paths and perhaps even to regional transformation.";2023;"role, agency, social, innovation, actor"

Therefore, knowledge and predictions of the rainy season such as its onset and ending are crucial for planning purposes. However, such information is currently not readily available for the local population. Moreover, an evaluation of existing rainy season indices shows that they are not optimally suited for the SPA and may not be directly applicable in a forecasting context. Therefore, we develop a new index, named Climandes index, which is tailored to the SPA and designed to be of use for operational monitoring and forecasting purposes. Using this index, we analyse the climatology and trends of the rainy season in the SPA. We find that the rainy season starts roughly between September and January with durations between 3 and 8 months. Both onset and duration show a pronounced northeast-southwest gradient, regions closer to the Amazon Basin have a considerably longer rainy season. The inter-annual variability of the onset is very high, that is, 2?5 months depending on the station, while the end of the rainy season shows a much lower variability (i.e., 1.5?3 months). The spatial patterns of total precipitation amount and dry spells within the rainy season are only weakly related to its timing. Trends in rainy season characteristics since 1965 are mostly weak and not significant, but generally indicate a tendency towards a shortening of the rainy season in the whole study area due to a later onset and an increase in precipitation sums during the rainy season in the northwestern study area.";2022;"rainy, season, index, trends, climatology"
"359";"The Development and Application of a Method to Measure Volatile Antimony Emissions from Soils and Antimony Release from Contaminated Soils";"Jaime Nicole Caplette";"In the environment, antimony (Sb) is a ubiquitous, but toxic, element. Due to the increased use of Sb in flame retardants, ammunition, as a PET catalyst, and its potential for applications in green energy, the exploitation and associated contamination of Sb has increased and likely will continue to increase. Due to its assumed geochemical similarities to the toxic element arsenic (As), the environmental fate of Sb has become an area of public concern. In general, the biogeochemical cycle of Sb remains to be elucidated with many unknowns. The behavior of inorganic Sb in the aerobic environment is relatively well understood but, Sb behavior in anaerobic environments has been poorly investigated. Even less studied are the microbial-mediated transformations of Sb in the environment such as its methylation and volatilization, although these transformations may have an impact on its mobility and toxicity. Environments susceptible to anoxic conditions (e.g., wetlands) constitute a major part of Earth?s surface and all soils are prone to periodic flooding therefore, the fate of Sb, behavior, and its transformations require further investigation. This dissertation aimed to investigate Sb transformations, such as its volatilization, and release from different soils under laboratory and field conditions from soils susceptible to waterlogging.  First, to investigate Sb volatilization in laboratory and field conditions a method had to be developed that had the following criteria 1) easy to deploy in the field, 2) cost-effective, and 3) user-friendly. Commercially available activated charcoal sorbent tubes (Sb-traps) were tested for their ability to capture stibines (trimethylstibine ((CH3)3Sb) and stibine (SbH3)) produced by hydride generation. The traps were extracted using a closed-vessel aqua regia extraction. The extraction recoveries, as total Sb, were 93.2 {$pm$";2022;"antimony, fate, transformations, volatilization, field conditions"

Fortunately, for historical climatologists, this extreme event occurred at a time when many stations across Europe, both private and as part of coordinated networks, were making quantitative observations of the weather. This means that several dozen early instrumental series are available to carry out an indepth study of this severe cold spell. While there have been attempts to present daily spatial information for this winter, there is more to be done to understand the weather variability and day-to-day processes that characterised this weather extreme. In this study, we seek to reconstruct daily spatial high-resolution temperature and sea level pressure fields of the winter 1788/89 in Europe from November through February. The reconstruction is performed with an analogue  esampling method (ARM) that uses both historical instrumental data and a weather type classification. Analogue reconstructions are then post-processed through an ensemble Kalman fitting (EnKF) technique. Validation experiments show good skill for both reconstructed variables, which manage to capture the dynamics of the extreme in relation to the large-scale circulation. These results are promising for more such studies to be undertaken, focusing on different extreme events and other regions in Europe and perhaps even further back in time. The dataset presented in this study may be of sufficient quality to allow historians to better assess the environmental and social impacts of the harsh weather.";2022;"winter, europe, climatology, reconstruction, extreme"
"362";"On the temporal clustering of European extreme precipitation events and its relationship to persistent and transient large-scale atmospheric drivers";"Yannick Barton and Pauline Marie Cl{'e";"Extreme precipitation events that occur in close succession can have important societal and economic repercussions. Here we use 42 years of reanalysis data (ERA-5) to investigate the link between Euro-Atlantic large-scale pattern of weather and climate variability and the temporal clustering of extreme rainfall events over Europe. We implicitly model the seasonal rate of extreme occurrences as part of a Poisson General Additive Model (GAM) using cyclic regression cubic splines. The smoothed seasonal rate of extreme rainfall occurrences is used to (i) infer the frequency of significant temporal clustering and (ii) implicitly serves as the baseline rate when modeling the effects of atmospheric drivers on extreme rainfall clustering. We use GAMs to model the association between the temporal clustering of extreme rainfall events and seven predominant year-round weather regimes in the Euro-Atlantic sector as well as a measure of synoptic-scale transient recurrent Rossby wave packets. Sub-seasonal clustering of precipitation events is significant at all grid-points over Europe; the proportion of extreme rainfall events that cluster in time ranges between 2% to 27%. The most relevant weather regime is the Atlantic Trough (corresponding to NAO+ with a southward shift of the jet) explaining most of the significant increase in clustering probability over Europe. The Greenland Blocking regime explains most of the clustering over the Iberian Peninsula. The Scandinavian Blocking regime is associated with a significant increase in clustering probability over the western Mediterranean, with a northwards shift in the signal to central Europe in summer.";2022;"extreme, rainfall, clustering, weather, Europe"

We surveyed 375 smallholder households, compared them according to three categories (employed, contract farmers, households non-engaged with commercial farms), and constructed a livelihood index. The results show that contract farmers and households employed on farms are only a small fraction of all smallholders. Employed and non-employed households show little difference in overall livelihood profiles. Results suggest that employment on large commercial farms is mainly a coping strategy for younger households or in times of need. Contract farmers were found only in a specific location and had better access to irrigation water and higher livestock holdings. Comparison with earlier data shows the persistence of precarious livelihood levels and household strategies aiming at diversification of activities, with little evolution over the last 20 years despite the presence of commercial farms. Overall, there is little evidence that the proximity to the commercial farms offers a way out of poverty for nearby smallholder farmers.";2022;"livelihood, smallholder, household, commercial, farms"

One of the main concerns arises from situations of low renewable production and high demand, which can hinder the power system. We analysed energy droughts, defined as periods of low energy production (wind plus solar generation) or high residual load (demand minus production), in terms of two main properties: duration and severity. We estimated the joint return periods associated with energy droughts of residual load and power production. We showed that moderate winter energy droughts of both low renewable production and high residual load occur every half a year, while summer events occur every 3.6 and 2.4 years (on average). As expected, the occurrence of energy droughts tends to decrease with the degree of the severity of the energy drought, and moderate and extreme energy droughts showed longer return periods for most countries. In general, we found a large variability across Europe in summer, with some countries (e.g. Italy) being more sensitive to energy droughts. Our results highlight the relevance of sharing RES during prolonged periods of low production and high demand.";2022;"carbon, variability, energy, droughts, Europe"

We use the homogenized data to analyse trends of the mean values as well as the lowest and highest quantiles of the distribution over the last 100 and 50-years. For the latter period, we find large regional differences, particularly between the southeastern and the northern part of the UK. The southeast has seen a faster warming, particularly for maximum temperatures in spring and summer, and a reduction of relative humidity; the northern mainland has become more humid and only slightly warmer. These differences become more evident for the highest quantiles and reflect a well-known pattern of climate change affecting the extra-tropics. Among the studied variables, the increases of wet bulb temperature and specific humidity are the most spatially homogeneous and are statistically significant for most stations in all seasons except winter.";2022;"homogenize, trends, region, temperature, humidity"

Due to the qualitative nature of these datasets, historical texts have been compiled and studied by historians aiming to describe the climate impact in socioeconomic aspects of human societies, but the inclusion of this information in past climate reconstructions remains fairly unexplored. Within this context, we present a novel approach to assimilate climate information contained in chronicles and annals from the 15th century to generate robust temperature and precipitation reconstructions of the Burgundian Low Countries, taking into account uncertainties associated with the descriptions of narrative sources. After data assimilation, our reconstructions present a high seasonal temperature correlation of approximately 0:8 independently of the climate model employed to estimate the background state of the atmosphere.

Sustainable intensi- fication (SI) of agriculture has been proposed as a promising concept for safeguarding global food security, while simultaneously protecting the environment and promoting good quality of life. However, SI often leads to context-specific sustainability trade-offs. Operationalising SI thus needs to be supported by transparent sus- tainability assessments. In this article, we propose a general systematic approach to developing context-specific frameworks for integrated sustainability assessment of agricultural intensity change. Firstly, we specify a comprehensive system representation for analysing how changes in agricultural intensity lead to a multitude of sustainability outcomes affecting different societal groups across geographical scales. We then introduce a procedure for identifying the attributes that are relevant for assessment within particular contexts, and respective indicator metrics. Finally, we illustrate the proposed approach by developing an assessment framework for evaluating a wide range of intensification pathways in Europe. The application of the approach revealed pro- cesses and effects that are relevant for the European context but are rarely considered in SI assessments. These include farmers? health, workers? living conditions, cultural heritage and sense of place of rural communities, animal welfare, impacts on sectors not directly related to agriculture (e.g., tourism), shrinking and ageing of rural population and consumers? health. The proposed approach addresses important gaps in SI assessments, and thus represents an important step forward in defining transparent procedures for sustainability assessments that can stimulate an informed debate about the operationalisation of SI and its contribution towards achieving SDGs.";2022;"agriculture, sustainable, intensification, assessment, framework"

Oven and Katherine Arrell";"Coseismic landslides represent the first stage of a broader cascading sequence of geohazards associated with high-magnitude continental earthquakes, with the subsequent remobilization of coseismic landslide debris posing a long-term post-seismic legacy in mountain regions. Here, we quantify the controls on the hazard posed by landslide remobilization and debris runout, and compare the overlap between areas at risk of runout and the pattern of post-seismic landslides and debris flows that actually occurred. Focusing on the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, we show that the extent of the area that could be affected by debris runout remained elevated above coseismic levels 4.5 years after the event. While 150 km2 (0.6% of the study area) was directly impacted by landslides in the earthquake, an additional 614 km2 (2.5%) was left at risk from debris runout, increasing to 777 km2 (3.2%) after the 2019 monsoon. We evaluate how this area evolved by comparing modelled predictions of runout from coseismic landslides to multi-temporal post-seismic landslide inventories, and find that 14% (85 km2) of the total modelled potential runout area experienced landslide activity within 4.5 years after the earthquake. This value increases to 32% when modelled runout probability is thresholded, equivalent to 10 km2 of realized runout from a remaining modelled area of 32 km2. Although the proportion of the modelled runout area from coseismic landslides that remains a hazard has decreased through time, the overall runout susceptibility for the study area remains high. This indicates that runout potential is changing both spatially and temporally as a result of changes to the landslide distribution after the earthquake. These findings are particularly important for understanding evolving patterns of cascading hazards following large earthquakes, which is crucial for guiding decision-making associated with post-seismic recovery and reconstruction.";2022;"coseismic, landslides, remobilization, debris, runout"

This recurrence can lead to persistent surface anomalies. Here, we first demonstrate the significance of RRWPs for persistent hot spells in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) using the ERA- Interim (ERA-I) reanalysis dataset and then examine the role of RRWPs and blocks for heatwaves over south-eastern Australia (SEA). A Weibull regression analysis shows that RRWPs are statistically associated with a significant increase in the duration of hot spells over several regions in the SH, including SEA. Two case studies of heatwaves in SEA in the summers of 2004 and 2009 illustrate the role of RRWPs in forming recurrent ridges (anticyclonic potential vorticity ? PV ? anomalies), aiding in the persistence of the heatwaves. Then, using a weather-station-based dataset to identify SEA heatwaves, we find that SEA heatwaves are more frequent than climatology during days with extreme RRWPs activity over SEA (high RSEA). On days with both high RSEA and at waves, circumglobal zonal wavenumber 4 and 5 (WN4, WN5) anomaly patterns are present in the composite mean of the upper-level PV field, with an anticyclonic PV anomaly over SEA. The Fourier decomposition of the PV and meridional wind velocity fields further reveals that the WN4 and WN5 components in the suitable phase aids in forming the ridge over SEA for days with high RSEA. In addition, we find anomalous blocking over the Indian and the South Pacific oceans duing SEA heatwaves, which may help to modulate the phase of RRWPs.";2022;"recurrent, heatwaves, southern, hemisphere, patterns"

In addition, physiochemical parameters of temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, and redox potential were measured in the field. The findings indicate three major controls of groundwater chemistry in the coastal aquifers of the Maharlu Lake including (1) lake water intrusions, (2) evaporites and carbonate dissolution-precipitation, and (3) input of organic matter probably linked to the seepage of domestic sewage with resulting sulfate reduction. In contrast, dissolution of minerals in surface sediments and direct evaporation of groundwater in the coastal aquifers seem to be insignificant based on geochemical ratios and water table depth. Concentrations of B, Li, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, and U increase, but Zn concentrations decrease in groundwater due to the lake water intrusions into the costal aquifers. Gypsum dissolution and consequent carbonate reactions cause B, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Zn, and U enrichment in the groundwater samples. These findings can provide water managers and local authorities with a comprehensive framework of the coastal groundwater geochemistry, allowing a better understanding of the effects of current management practices and the implementation of mitigation approaches such as reduction of groundwater extraction to limit further lake saltwater intrusion and water resources deterioration.";2022;"degradation, salinity, geochemical, heavy, metals"

In the Alps, however, such records are relatively rare, especially in the southern slope. We recently found and digitized two new pressure and temperature series for the Alpine cities of Rovereto (1800?1839) and Bolzano/Bozen (1842?1849) covering together the first half of the 19th century, a period characterized by large climate variability and important extreme events. The meteorological record of Rovereto, in particular, is the oldest available for the southeastern Alps. We used the shorter record of Bolzano/Bozen as a testbed for different digitization methods, namely citizen science and machine-learning based Optical Character Recognition. The data are converted to modern units, quality controlled, and homogenized.

"391";"Social innovations in healthcare provision: an analysis of knowledge types and their spatial context";"Pascal Tschumi and Heike Mayer";"Peripheral regions face the challenge of ensuring adequate healthcare provision. As a solution to such challenges, social innovations are introduced. In relevant literature, it is recognized that the exchange of knowledge among diverse actors is a defining aspect of social innovations and that it is a crucial component of their success in peripheral areas. However, little is known about the characteristics and the spatial context of knowledge in social innovations. We address this research gap by analyzing micro-level knowledge dynamics in four social innovations in the healthcare sector of a Swiss mountain region. We distinguish three knowledge types according to the knowledge base approach: synthetic (practical and tacit), analytical (scientific and codified) and symbolic (semiotic and tacit). From innovation biographies and semi-structured interviews, we find that synthetic knowledge is the type used most throughout the whole social innovation process and that it is often combined with the other two knowledge types. Local actors and extra-local actors who are locally embedded contribute the most knowledge. The findings indicate that the social innovation actors require a considerable number of craft and practical skills to make use of their own analytical or symbolic knowledge, as well as to link these three knowledge types from different actors and spatial contexts. It seems that, in a strongly regulated sector like healthcare that primarily depends on (analytical) expert knowledge, analytical knowledge from extra-local inputs is not sufficient. Rather, highly knowledgeable, locally embedded actors are needed to combine synthetic knowledge with other knowledge types. Our findings suggest that successful social innovations combine locally and extra locally acquired synthetic knowledge with analytical and symbolic knowledge to solve peripheral healthcare challenges and to contribute to regional wellbeing.";2022;"healthcare, knowledge, social, innovation, peripheral"

Sprenger and Olivia Romppainen-Martius";"The early summer of 2021 was a season of extremes across Europe. Heatwaves, droughts and wildfires hit Eastern Europe and the Baltic, while repeated extreme precipitation in Western Europe culminated in massive floods in mid-July. The large-scale circulation during this period was remarkably persistent, with an extremely meridionally amplified flow over Europe. Recurrent blocking over the Baltic and Rossby wave breaking in the North Atlantic led to frequent heavy precipitation in Western Europe and the Black Sea and to warm and dry conditions over Eastern Europe. These conditions persisted for a month as the blocks and wave breaking episodes strengthened one another, while three closely spaced extratropical transitions of tropical cyclones in the eastern North Atlantic led to recurrent amplification of the jet. Seasonal anomalies thus emerge from the complex interactions of individual weather events, offering an interesting storyline for climate impact assessment and a formidable challenge for (sub-) seasonal prediction.";2022;"extremes, europe, circulation, precipitation, events"

With the growing share of wind and solar power in the European power system and their strong weather dependence, balancing the energy demand and supply becomes a great challenge. We characterize energy compound events, defined as periods of simultaneous low renewable production of wind and solar power, and high electricity demand. Using a logistic regression approach, we examine the influence of meteorological and atmospheric drivers on energy compound events. Moreover, we assess the spatial coherence of energy compound events that pose a major challenge within an interconnected power grid, as they can affect multiple countries simultaneously. On average, European countries are exposed to winter energy compound events more than twice per year. The combination of extremely low temperatures and low wind speeds is associated with a higher probability of occurrence of energy compound events. Furthermore, we show that blocked weather regimes have a major influence on energy compound events. In particular, Greenland and European blocking lead to widespread energy compound events that affect multiple countries at the same time. Our results highlight the relevance of weather regimes resulting in synchronous spatial energy compound events, which might pose a greater risk within a potential fully interconnected European grid.";2022;"decarbonized, impacts, renewable, events, spatial"

Ziegel";"To mitigate the impacts associated with adverse weather conditions, meteorological services issue weather warnings to the general public. These warnings rely heavily on forecasts issued by underlying prediction systems. When deciding which prediction system(s) to utilise to construct warnings, it is important to compare systems in their ability to forecast the occurrence and severity of extreme weather events. However, evaluating forecasts for extreme events is known to be a challenging task. This is exacerbated further by the fact that high-impact weather often manifests as a result of several confounding features, a realisation that has led to considerable research on so-called compound weather events. Both univariate and multivariate methods are therefore required to evaluate forecasts for high-impact weather. In this paper, we discuss weighted verification tools, which allow particular outcomes to be emphasised during forecast evaluation. We review and compare different approaches to construct weighted scoring rules, both in a univariate and multivariate setting, and we leverage existing results on weighted scores to introduce weighted probability integral transform (PIT) histograms, allowing forecast calibration to be assessed conditionally on particular outcomes having occurred. To illustrate the practical benefit afforded by these weighted verification tools, they are employed in a case study to evaluate forecasts for extreme heat events issued by the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology (MeteoSwiss).";2022;"forecast, extreme, weather, verification, weighted"

In this article, we use a statistical approach based on deep learning and a high-resolution digital elevation model to spatially downscale hourly near-surface wind fields at coarse resolution from ERA5 reanalysis from their original 25-km grid to a 1.1-km grid. A 1.1-km-resolution wind dataset for 2016?20 from the operational numerical weather prediction model COSMO-1 of the national weather service MeteoSwiss is used to train and validate our model, a generative adversarial network (GAN) with gradient penalized Wasserstein loss aided by transfer learning. The results are realistic-looking high-resolution historical maps of gridded hourly wind fields over Switzerland and very good and robust predictions of the aggregated wind speed distribution. Regionally averaged image-specific metrics show a clear improvement in prediction relative to ERA5, with skill measures generally better for locations over the flatter Swiss Plateau than for Alpine regions. The downscaled wind fields demonstrate higher-resolution, physically plausible orographic effects, such as ridge acceleration and sheltering, that are not resolved in the original ERA5 fields.";2022;"downscaling, topography, deep learning, high-resolution, wind"

They generally encompass a combination of dynamic and thermodynamic processes, as well as drivers external to the climate system, such as anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and land use change. Here we present the ExtremeX multi-model intercomparison experiment, which was designed to investigate the contribution of dynamic and thermodynamic processes to recent weather and climate extremes. The numerical experiments are performed with three Earth system models: CESM, MIROC, and EC-Earth. They include control experiments with interactive atmosphere and land surface conditions, as well as experiments wherein the atmospheric circulation, soil moisture, or both are constrained using observation-based data. The temporal evolution and magnitude of temperature anomalies during heatwaves are well represented in the experiments with a constrained atmosphere. However, the magnitude of mean climatological biases in temperature and precipitation are not greatly reduced in any of the constrained experiments due to persistent or newly introduced biases. This highlights the importance of error compensations and tuning in the standard model versions. To show one possible application, ExtremeX is used to identify the main drivers of heatwaves and warm spells. The results reveal that both atmospheric circulation patterns and soil moisture conditions substantially contribute to the occurrence of these events. Soil moisture effects are particularly important in the tropics, the monsoon areas, and the Great Plains of the United States, whereas atmospheric circulation effects are major drivers in other midlatitude and high-latitude regions.";2022;"mechanisms, extremes, experiments, drivers, weather"

LAIs can considerably darken (lowered albedo) the glacier surface, enhancing their melt. We combined chemical and mineralogical laboratory analyses of surface and ice core samples with field-based spectral reflectance measurements to investigate the nature and properties of such LAIs. Using remote sensing-based albedo maps, we upscaled local information to glacier-wide coverage. We then used a model to evaluate the sensitivity of surface mass balance to a change in ice and snow albedo. The across-scale surface observations in combination with ice core analysis revealed a history of over half a century of LAIs deposition. We found traces of mining residuals in glacier surface samples. The glaciers with highest mass loss in the catchment present enhanced concentrations of surface dust particles with low reflectance properties. Our results indicate that dust particles with strong light-absorbing capacity have been mobilized from mine tailings and deposited on the nearby glacier surfaces. Large-scale assessment from satellite-based observations revealed darkening (ice albedo lowering) at most investigated glacier tongues from 1989 to 2018. Glacier melt is sensitive to ice albedo. We believe that an accelerated winter and spring snow albedo decrease, partially triggered by surface impurities, might be responsible for the above-average mass loss encountered in this catchment.";2022;"light-absorbing, impurities, glaciers, albedo, melt"

Our findings are based on a unique four-decade satellite-based time series of snow cover information. We reveal strong variability of SSC at all time scales. We find significantly decreasing SSC trends in individual summer and winter months and a declining tendency from mid-spring to mid-fall, indicating a shift in seasonality.

However, the merits of MSPs are limited in contexts with strong power imbalances and entrenched conflict histories. This study analyses an MSP from Myanmar. We developed an analytical framework based on literature on MSPs and social learning and used qualitative methods such as participatory observation and interviews. The study investigates how the MSP was designed and governed and whether it was effective in addressing the land conflicts around oil palm concessions. The study discusses several promising factors of the MSP for being effective, such as adequate inclusion of stakeholders, secured resources, or effective facilitation. However, the analysis also reveals how hindering factors such as lack of a clear mandate, goal, and decision-making competences of the MSP, insufficient communication, or lack of legal and land governance expertise contributed to only limited effectiveness of the MSP. Further, we discuss whether the MSP was a suitable approach in the given context of nontransparent land governance mechanisms, persisting power disparities, and longstanding conflict history.

"412";"The dilemma of women empowerment in informal artisanal and small-scale gold ore mining in Ghana";"James Adam Natia and Timothy Adams and Jean-David Gerber and Mich{`e";"For several years, women demand more decision-making power from their husbands and the society. Studies indicate that egalitarian decision-making power can be beneficial in many important ways to the household and society, and the pathway to this desire policy objective is through women empowerment. Yet, this is not as obvious as it seems. On the one hand, women empowerment is a game changer. On the other hand, the problem of women empowerment is complex. Thus, our goal is to evaluate the gendered intersectional power dynamics operating in informal artisanal and small-scale mining and the impact on women?s empowerment to balance decision-making power in the household. Theoretically, we ask: How does women empowerment enable women to demand more decision- making power from their husbands following their participation in informal mining? And how do men react to women empowerment? Empirically, 38 biographic inter- views, 6 key informant interviews and 8 focus group discussions were conducted. Results show that informal mining improves the financial power of women and increases their bargaining power to demand more decision-making power from their husbands. Moreover, increase in women?s financial leverage can have a nuanced effect on their empowerment since men can intervene there by playing on the patriarchal rules. In conclusion, women empowerment is complex, and the major challenge is societal. Consequently, policy actions are required to vigorously address societal norms through formal education and awareness creation to bring about transformations.";2022;"women, empowerment, decision-making, mining, society"

The occurrence and distribution of these negative social effects are strongly influenced by land policies. This makes it crucial to monitor the effects of densification policies and understand what processes shape urban development in the context of densification. To do so, detailed, large-scale international comparisons of densification patterns, including building and social changes, are needed. We address this issue by introducing a method to measure and compare urban development in two countries with contrasting planning systems: the Netherlands, where public actors play a strong and active role, and Switzerland, where strong private property titles and a highly democratic planning system are prevailing. Our GIS-based method analyses densification processes within their surrounding morphological and socio-demographic context. A k-proto cluster analysis on highly detailed spatial and statistical data based on housing units, covering 2011 to 2019, results in five densification types. The distribution of these types reveals different patterns in the two city regions of Utrecht (NL) and Bern (CH). Most strikingly, contiguous redevelopments frequently occurred in Utrecht but hardly in Bern, pointing at possible advantages for Dutch municipalities to intervene in property rights. While having developed an empirical basis in this study, future research that refines the analysis of the legal, planning and ownership conditions underlying the identified densification patterns can contribute significantly to policy evaluation.";2022;"urban, densification, social, policies, comparison"

It bridges planning, neoinstitutionalism and power to appraise contested urban redevelopments such as they take place under densification. This article asks: (1) Which power structures are at work in urban development processes and what forms do their involvement in the planning process take? (2) How does the identification of power structures help explaining why the social dimension of sustainability is recurrently being neglected in densification processes? (3) What does their identification mean for planning as a practice and as a discipline? Through its impact on the built environment and on existing property rights and interests, densification creates not only winners, but also losers, especially among those inhabitants who cannot afford the higher rents following redevelopments in favor of density. Due to its conflictual nature, densification is therefore an ideal subject to study power in planning. In this article, planning is appraised as a public policy regulating the use of land and land-related resources such as housing. Four situations of power exercise can be identified in this process of regulation. Their conceptual characterization constitutes the first part of the article.

"431";"The Bittersweet Taste of ?Miracle Growth?: A Political Economy Analysis of Poverty, Labour, and Economic Growth in the Coffee Heartlands of Laos and Rwanda";"Patrick Illien";"Laos and Rwanda have recorded two decades of sustained and fast economic ?miracle growth?. The nature of these processes and their impact on the livelihoods of the rural population are, however, strongly contested. This dissertation adopts a comparative political economy approach to examine the under-researched employment nexus as a key mediator between growth and poverty. It builds on extensive mixed methods fieldwork in the main coffee-producing zones of Laos (the Bolaven Plateau) and Rwanda (Nyamasheke district), including two household surveys, ethnographic methods, and over 100 qualitative interviews ranging from semi-structured to life history interviews and focus group discussions. The dissertation starts by developing a new framework to conceptualize pro-poor growth trajectories in developing economies (paper I). By integrating political settlements and pro-poor development strategy approaches, this framework not only accounts for the key mechanisms linking growth and poverty but also for the underlying political conditions. Its empirical application to Laos and Rwanda reveals that structural change has been limited in both cases and that most households continue to make a living in casual agricultural work or petty commodity production amid increasing land pressure. In Laos, inequality has risen, and growth has not been pro-poor in monetary terms, while in Rwanda, questions around official data do not allow a conclusive assessment. Nevertheless, non-monetary poverty has been significantly reduced in both countries, not least due to major investments in the provision of basic services. Using the two household surveys, the dissertation zooms in on the coffee heartlands in the Bolaven Plateau and Nyamasheke (paper II) and identifies key markers of non-monetary poverty by conceptually and empirically comparing the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) with the Extreme Deprivation Index (EDI) framework for the first time. Both locally adapted indices find that poor households are strongly characterized by lower levels of secondary education and literacy, rudimentary sanitation conditions, a relative lack of access to land, and a high dependence on casual agricultural wage employment. Additional regression and classification analysis shows that the EDI framework may be most appropriate in rural high deprivation contexts, whereas the MPI framework may be preferable in relatively low deprivation contexts. Quantitative stratification, however, is limited in its understanding of the processes through which economic growth can both reinforce and reduce poverty. This dissertation therefore argues for a relational shift in the study of social differentiation and poverty to overcome these limitations. It undertakes a literature review within agrarian studies (paper III) to outline the implications of such a shift. Drawing on detailed mixed methods data, a relational approach is then applied to a case study of class dynamics in Nyamasheke (paper IV). It shows that a focus on labour relations ? examining underlying drivers, functions, and power relations ? between and within land-poor households can uncover avenues of accumulation and exploitation that would otherwise remain invisible. Instead of the commonly portrayed mass of undifferentiated smallholders, households ingeniously construct piecemeal livelihood patchworks under intense temporal and commodification pressure in localized patterns of micro-capitalism. While the recent growth experiences in Laos and Rwanda have been astonishing indeed, it is a bittersweet success riddled with contradictions and mounting pressures on rural households. The integrated framework and relational approach presented here offer conceptual and methodological tools to help make sense of these processes both in the aggregate as well as in lived experiences on the ground. The dissertation further demonstrates that the MPI and EDI frameworks can be useful for beneficiary targeting as well as for programme or policy evaluation depending on the context, programme needs, and resources. Finally, it shows why safeguarding land access of the poorest and promoting policies to tighten rural labour markets should be key ingredients of any pro-poor development strategy.";2022;"Laos, Rwanda, Growth, Poverty, Rural"

In many areas in West Africa, fragmentation has reduced the original continuous forest ecosystems to small and isolated forest patches, mostly managed by local communities. While the importance of such small patches in biodiversity conservation is recognized in literature, evidence from tropical forest ecosystems and plant-based studies are still limited. In our study, we (i) assessed the contribution of small, unprotected forest patches to tree species conservation; (ii) determined the variation of seed dispersal syndromes in tree stands between a continuous forest and small forest patches; and (iii) identified the drivers of tree species colonization among forest patches. We sampled 69 plots in the Lama forest reserve (continuous forest) and the surrounding small isolated forest patches within 20-km radius. Trees and natural regenerations were recorded in two vegetation types including the degraded dense forest and old fallow. For each species, the IUCN conservation status and functional traits including dispersal syndrome, seed weight and maximum height were recorded. We used Generalized Linear Models to identify the determinants of immigrant regeneration densities in isolated forest patches. In total, 103 woody species were recorded and the species richness was higher in the forest patches than in the continuous forest for all vegetation types. In the dense vegetation, a similar trend was found and the number of threatened species was higher in the forest patches. Tree assemblages differed between the continuous forest and the forest patches. Tree density was higher in the continuous forest than in small forest patches. Defaunation somewhat affected the regeneration of disturbed forest patches as germination and seedling were dominated by abiotic-dispersed species and local species. Taller or heavier seed species were more likely to colonize forest patches and the density of tree species in a forest patch increased with abundance of immigrant regeneration in the nearest neighbor. We recommend the implementation of sustainable management in form of participative restoration of low-regenerated species in forest remnants  for enhanced biodiversity conservation.";2022;"conservation, forest, fragmentation, biodiversity, regeneration"

Despite the recent increase in their availability and accessibility,  questions often remain on how to best assess the accuracy of these products, since it is pivotal that these be rigorously validated before they are used for scientific investigation and decision making. There are several methods for validating spatially continuous remote sensing-derived products, including comparisons to field surveys, cross-comparisons and verification of physical consistency using reference data. However, there exist few or no validation strategies for validating spatially non-continuous products such as forest patches. In effect, forest patches, as with many other thematic maps, contain information that is discrete, not spatially continuous, and not normally distributed; thus, a validation strategy that makes these assumptions may be inappropriate for such a product.   We present an integrative approach for assessing the accuracy of a remote sensing-derived product identifying forest patches found within agricultural landscapes of West Africa. The method is based on the well-established error matrix approach and uses a spatial sampling strategy that determines the sample size based on spatial autocorrelation, select sample points based on spatial uniformity and heterogeneity, and assesses the accuracy by comparing sample points and reference data. Compared to other random sampling approaches, ours ensures that a representative sample is used for the accuracy assessment. This representativeness was achieved by utilizing a stratification method that enabled different categories of forest patches across different ecoregions in the map to be included in the sample size.   While further tests are required, the preliminary results show that our method has the potential to effectively assess the accuracy of forest patches in West Africa and can therefore be adapted for validating other spatially non-continuous remote sensing products.";2022;"remote, validation, forest, accuracy, africa"

On the one hand, the presence of loess results in a particular set of landforms such as loess dells, gullies, sunken roads and sinkholes of both natural and anthropogenic origin. On the other hand, the many outcrops of loess with several metres of height still reveal unprecedented insights in the climatic and settlement history of Lower Austria. Both, sunken roads and palaeosols may be seen as silent witnesses of past landscape changes but on a very different time scale. Originating from a natural gully erosion process, sunken roads evolved from gullies by their transformation in access paths leading to agricultural fields. Many driving forces influenced the vertical and lateral erosion of sunken roads, which showed increasing erosion rates of up to 15?30 cm per year until the mid-twentieth century. Nowadays, many sunken roads have disappeared and many remaining ones are paved or protected from further erosion and are transformed to cellar lanes (sunken roads with wine cellars dug next to each other into the loess wall). Results from analysing the ages of palaeosols found in Lower Austrian loess profiles are internationally important. Still to the day, with upcoming new dating methods and the chance for more detailed analysis, new insights into the stratigraphy, the related ages, palaeorelief and climate oscillations are found in close collaborations of geographers and archaeologists.

Fluvial sediments in valleys north of the recent course of the Danube show a different, more northerly course of the Palaeo-Danube in the late Miocene. In the late Pliocene and Pleistocene, the Danube deeply incised into the southeastern margin of the Bohemian Massif along its recent course, presumably triggered by uplift caused by the northward moving Alpine units.

Since the Middle Ages terraces with simple rock walls, which are now a characteristic feature of the valley, have been constructed for easier cultivation. The Wachau has been inhabited since Palaeolithic times. Several important artefacts like sculptures of women found in Stratzing and Willendorf document the early human habitation that led to a continuous development until today.

Thus, agricultural sustainability should be considered a social concept, reliable enough to support decision makers and policy development in a broad context. The aim of this manuscript was to develop a methodology for the assessment of the sustainability of soil improving cropping systems (SICS) in Europe. For this purpose, a decision tree based on weights (%) was chosen because it allows more flexibility. The methodology was tested with data from the SoilCare Horizon 2020 study site in Germany for the assessment of the impact of the integration of cover crops into the crop rotation. The effect on the environmental indicators was slightly positive, but most assessed properties did not change over the short course of the experiment. Farmers reported that the increase in workload was outweighed by a reputation gain for using cover crops. The incorporation of cover crops reduced slightly the profitability, due to the costs for seeds and establishment of cover crops. The proposed assessment methodology provides a comprehensive summary to assess the agricultural sustainability of SICS.";2022;"agricultural, sustainability, methodology, assessment, cover crops"

Yet identifying how land users perceive land degradation and their capacity to manage land in an environmentally sustainable manner can influence the measures initiated to address it. Using the case of Niger State, Nigeria, this study examines land users? perceptions of land degradation and land management measures to address it in the Nigerian Guinea Savannah. We used the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy for degradation status, selecting 30 communities based on the extent of degraded areas. We adapted the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies, Sustainable Land Management questionnaires to capture perceptions and administered 225 questionnaires to land users. Through key informant interviews, we collected narrative insights and data on perspectives and motivations of land users to understand land degradation situations and to interpret the questionnaire surveys. We analysed data through descriptive statistics, Principal Component Analysis and qualitative analysis. Our analysis identified four perceptions dimensions of land degradation characteristics, two perceptions dimensions of land degradation drivers, and six perceptions dimensions of sustainable land management. The results also confirmed that degradation in Niger State is both due to widespread unsustainable human activities within Niger state and those by migrant farmers and pastoralism from adjoining Sudan Sahelian states that push people further south, a leakage of ongoing land degradation and conflicts in other areas. To deal with local land degradation in Niger State, improved land tenure, alternative livelihood strategies, poverty eradication and awareness, nature-based sustainable land management practices such as tree-based initiatives, environmentally friendly agriculture such as Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration supported by the necessary political will and institutions are critical.";2022;"productivity, perceptions, degradation, management, sustainable"

Thus, the integration of environmental and social dimensions is key for economic development. In recent years, several frameworks have been proposed to assess the overall sustainability of farms. Nevertheless, the myriad of existing frameworks and the variety of indicators result in difficulties in selecting the most appropriate framework for study site application. This manuscript aims to: (i) understand the criteria to select appropriate frameworks and summarize the range of those being used to assess sustainability; (ii) identify the available frameworks to assess agricultural sustainability; and (iii) analyze the strengths, weaknesses and applicability of each framework. Six frameworks, namely SAFA, RISE, MASC, LADA, SMART and public goods (PG), were identified. Results show that SMART is the framework that considers, in a balanced way, the environmental, sociocultural and economic dimensions of sustainability, whereas others focused on the environmental (RISE), environmental and economic (PG) and sociocultural (SAFA) dimension. However, depending on the scale assessment, sector of application and the sustainability completeness intended, all frameworks are suitable for the assessment.

While many scholars have assessed the drivers of SLM uptake for restoring land affected by desertification, drought, and floods (SDG 15.3 and partly SDG 2.4), little is known about the implication of SLM implementation on invasive alien species (IAS) management. This study aimed at understanding the challenges and proposing solutions for the uptake of SLMs with respect to the management of the invasive tree, Prosopis juliflora, in Baringo County, Kenya. Data were collected with semi-structured questionnaires, the responses were coded into themes, and c-coefficient tables were used to determine code linkages. Our results show that the availability of incentives is the main motivation for invasion management. Thus, management efforts have often focused on private parcels, while communally shared lands tended to be neglected despite their vulnerability to invasion. We conclude that sustainable IAS management lies at a landscape scale, and thus the national IAS management strategies should adopt a collective approach by empowering local actors to engage in SLM implementation.";2022;"sustainable, degradation, management, invasive, implementation"

Ramos and Pedro M. Sousa and Tim Woollings";"The physical understanding and timely prediction of extreme weather events are of enormous importance to society due to their associated impacts. In this article, we highlight several types of weather extremes occurring in Europe in connection with a particular atmospheric flow pattern, known as atmospheric blocking. This flow pattern effectively blocks the prevailing westerly large-scale atmospheric flow, resulting in changing flow anomalies in the vicinity of the blocking system and persistent conditions in the immediate region of its occurrence. Blocking systems are long-lasting, quasi-stationary and self-sustaining systems that occur frequently over certain regions. Their presence and characteristics have an impact on the predictability of weather extremes and can thus be used as potential indicators. The phasing between the surface and the upper-level blocking anomalies is of major importance for the development of the extreme event. In summer, heat waves and droughts form below the blocking anticyclone primarily via large-scale subsidence that leads to cloud-free skies and, thus, persistent shortwave radiative warming of the ground. In winter, cold waves that occur during atmospheric blocking are normally observed downstream or south of these systems. Here, meridional advection of cold air masses from higher latitudes plays a decisive role. Depending on their location, blocking systems also may lead to a shift in the storm track, which influences the occurrence of wind and precipitation anomalies. Due to these multifaceted linkages, compound events are often observed in conjunction with blocking conditions. In addition to the aforementioned relations, the predictability of extreme events associated with blocking and links to climate change are assessed. Finally, current knowledge gaps and pertinent research perspectives for the future are discussed.";2022;"physical, extreme, weather, blocking, predictability"

However, to date, there are no available anaerobic isolates capable of As methylation, whether sulfate-reducing or otherwise. The isolation of such a microorganism has been thwarted by the fact that the anaerobic bacteria harbouring a functional arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM) tested to date did not methylate As in pure culture. Additionally, fortuitous As methylation can result from the release of non-specific methyltransferases upon lysis. Thus, we combined metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics to identify the microorganisms actively methylating As in anoxic soil-derived microbial cultures. Based on the metagenome-assembled genomes of microorganisms expressing ArsM, we isolated Paraclostridium sp. strain EML, which was confirmed to actively methylate As anaerobically.

To determine the impacts on the afro-alpine environment and to assess the potential socio-economic consequences, the monitoring of essential climate and environmental variables at high elevation is fundamental. However, long-term temperature observations on the African continent above 3000-m are very rare. Here we present a consistent multiannual dataset of hourly ground temperatures for the Bale Mountains in the southern Ethiopian Highlands, which comprise Africa's largest tropical alpine area. The dataset covers the period from January 2017 to January 2020. To characterise and continuously monitor the mountain climate and ecosystem of the Bale Mountains along an elevation gradient from 3493 to 4377-m, ground temperature data loggers have been installed at seven sites at 2-cm depth; at four sites at 10-cm depth; and at five sites at 2, 10, and 50-cm depth. The statistical analysis of the generated time series reveals that ground temperatures in the Bale Mountains are subject to large daily fluctuations of up to 40-?C and minor seasonal variations on the order of 5 to 10-?C. Besides incoming short-wave radiation, ground moisture, and clouds at night, slope orientation and the type of vegetation coverage seem to be the main factors controlling daily and seasonal ground temperature variations. On the central Sanetti Plateau above 3800?4000-m, the mean annual ground temperature ranges from 9 to 11-?C. However, nocturnal ground frost down to a depth of 5-cm occurs frequently during the dry season from November to February. At the five sites where ground temperature is measured at three depths, the monitoring will be continued to trace long-term changes. To promote the further use of the ground temperature dataset by the wider research community dealing with the climate and geo-ecology of tropical mountains in eastern Africa, it is made freely available via the open-access repository Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6047457 (Groos et al., 2022).";2022;"tropical, mountains, africa, ground, temperature"

In this contribution, we use a 5-year continuous time series of streamflow and bedload transport monitoring in a 13.4-km2 snow-dominated Alpine watershed in the Western Swiss Alps to investigate hydrological drivers of bedload transport. Following a calibration of the bedload sensors, and a quantification of the hydraulic forcing of streamflow upon bedload, a hydrological analysis is performed to identify daily flow hydrographs influenced by different hydrological drivers: rainfall, snowmelt, and combined rain and snowmelt events. We then quantify their respective contribution to bedload transport. Results emphasize the importance of combined rain and snowmelt events, for both annual bedload volumes (77% on average) and peaks in bedload transport rate. A non-negligible, but smaller, amount of bedload transport may occur during late summer and autumn storms, once the snowmelt contribution and baseflow have significantly decreased (9% of the annual volume on average). Although rainfall-driven changes in flow hydrographs are responsible for a large majority of the annual bedload volumes (86% on average), the identified melt-only events also represent a substantial contribution (14% on average). The results of this study help to improve current predictions of bedload transport through a better understanding of the bedload magnitude-frequency relationship under different hydrological conditions.

Evaluating the effectiveness of policies and programmes thus requires practical, reliable and context-relevant measures of poverty. This article is the first to compare the new Extreme Deprivation Index (EDI) framework with the increasingly used global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) framework. Locally adapted versions of both non-monetary poverty measures were calculated for each household using an original survey in Rwanda?s main coffee-producing region (a high deprivation context) and another in Laos?s main coffee-producing region (a relatively low deprivation context). We examine the resulting poverty profiles and discuss implications for policy design and evaluation. We find that, despite limited overlap, in both contexts each index identifies households that are consistently worse off on multiple key markers of poverty and can therefore be considered valid measures. In addition, known key markers of poverty can predict adjusted global MPI status better than EDI status in Laos, whereas the EDI framework performs best in Rwanda. We conclude that the EDI framework provides a quick and reliable way to identify households with very low standards of living in high deprivation contexts. It is particularly useful for programmes with limited resources operating in comparatively poor rural settings.";2022;"poverty, measures, comparison, index, effectiveness"

Dippold and Sebastian Loeppmann";"The functional relevance of microbial necromass in terrestrial biogeochemical cycles remains one of the unresolved mysteries of element cycling in ecosystems, especially considering the high microbial abundance and turnover in soil. We therefore established a protocol to manufacture multi-isotope (14C, 15N and 33P) labeled microbial necromass to comprehensively track the turnover of microbial necromass elements within element cycles. This protocol encompasses the i) microbial cultivation of Pseudomonas kilonensis ACN4 (Gram-negative) and Bacillus licheniformis DSM13 (Gram-positive) on labeled minimal medium as well as fungal cultivation of Hypsizygus tessulatus on a complex yeast medium, ii) quantification of radio- (14C, 33P) and stable (15N) isotope incorporation as well their cellular pool partitioning, and iii) determination of element and tracer isotope uptake efficiency. We achieved 1 g of bacterial biomass per liter minimum medium within 24 h and 2.9 g l-1 fungal biomass in complex medium within 18 d. This production rate enabled us to produce more than 100 g of necromass within only one half-life time of 33P, including post-harvest processing. Isotope uptake and incorporation for 33P ranged from 10 to 73%, for 15N from 24 to 52%, and for 14C from 12 to 23%. Each of the cultivated species showed individual patterns of tracer element uptake. The nutritional value of the carbon- (C), nitrogen- (N) and phosphorus- (P) labeled microbial necromass was characterized by a water-based, necromass speciesspecific partitioning scheme with subsequent elemental analysis of the pools. We separated Gram-negative, Gram-positive and fungi?s cellular pools to characterize element and tracer partitioning among dissolved versus particulate fractions. That is essential because these properties subsequently affect the respective pool's availability for ecosystem nutrition. Our procedure allows a defined production of microorganism-based necromass, enabling versatile use to determine necromass-related nutrient fluxes in terrestrial ecosystem studies.";2022;"functional, microbial, isotopes, turnover, biomass"

"477";"Measurement of methane emissions from confined sources using the inverse dispersion method";"Marcel B{\"u";"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are reported in annual national inventories. Globally, the main anthropogenic sources of methane (CH4) are fossil fuel burning, agriculture, landfills, and waste management. The main source of CH4 from agriculture is enteric fermentation in the digestive tract of ruminants and a minor source are emissions from manure management. In 2019, the Swiss Federal council decided that Switzerland must reduce its GHG emission to net-zero until 2050. To reach this goal, the agricultural sector is obliged to contribute to the emission reduction. However, emissions from the agriculture and waste sector imply large uncertainties as, among other reasons, the availability of data based on real-world studies is limited. Several investigations showed that measurements from laboratory- or pilot-scale experiments do often not comply with real-world conditions. For studies under real-world conditions, different measurement approaches are available. One of the most promising methods is the inverse dispersion method (IDM) that was applied in this thesis to measure CH 4 emissions from livestock production and the waste management sector in order to evaluate the method for complex source configurations and to specify emission factors of these sources.  For the IDM, a backward Lagrangian stochastic (bLS) model in combination with concentration measurements up- and downwind of the source using open-path tunable diode laser spectrometers (GasFinders) were employed. GasFinders are simple to use, flexible in their application, and relatively cost-effective measuring devices. However, several challenges were faced and overcome throughout the thesis. The precision of the employed GasFinder model was about 10 times lower than the manufacturer stated, which necessitated adaptation in the measurement setup. Additionally, an intercomparison before or after each measurement campaign was necessary to correct the offset and span between the employed GasFinders.  In the first two studies presented in this thesis, experiments were conducted to evaluate the IDM. In a third study, experiments were conducted to assess the handling of complex source configurations with the IDM. The emissions determined in the third study were used as a basis for emission factors of Swiss biogas plants (BGPs) and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).  In the first study, a known and predefined amount of CH 4 was released by an artificial source in a barn that mimics a dairy housing. For concentration measurements, GasFinders with a path length ii Thesis summary of 110 m were placed in downwind direction of the barn at a distance of 50 m, 100 m, 150 m, and 200 m. At the first three distances, an ultrasonic anemometer was placed in the middle of the GasFinder path length for executing turbulence measurements. Upwind of the barn, an additional GasFinder and an ultrasonic anemometer were installed. The main objective was to test the ideal measurement fetch for the IDM. The results of this experiment are included in the method section, where the conditions and the setup of an IDM measurement campaign are outlined. A release rate of 140 norm litres min -1 was chosen to achieve sufficient concentration enhancement at the GasFinder locations. The mean recovery rates of the experiment were between 0.55 ? 0.76.  In the second study, CH4 emission measurements from a naturally ventilated dairy housing were conducted in two measurement campaigns. During part of the campaign duration, emissions were also measured inside the housing with the inhouse tracer ratio method (iTRM). This allowed comparing the IDM with the iTRM, which was considered as a reference method for naturally ventilated livestock housings. For simultaneous emission intervals, the average IDM emissions were lower by 1 % and 8 % compared to the iTRM measurements, which was within the uncertainty of either of the two methods. Additionally, an uncertainty analysis for the IDM showed that measurement campaigns of at least 10 consecutive days are necessary to acquire reliable emission data.  The third study addressed the handling of complex source configurations with the IDM. Emissions from four agricultural BGPs and two WWTPs in Switzerland were measured. The average BGP CH 4 emission varied between 0.39 kg h -1 and 2.22 kg h-1, which was less than 5 % of the plant?s CH4 production. The average CH4 emissions for the two WWTPs were 166 g population-equivalent-1 y -1 and 381 g population-equivalent-1 y -1, respectively. The BGPs often had livestock housings nearby that needed to be discriminated from the plant emission. It was demonstrated how the plant emission can be corrected for the nearby CH4 sources, which confounded the GasFinder measurements. Further, it was demonstrated how to combine multiple GasFinder measurements to a single line concentration for the bLS modelling. WWTPs are complex sources as they consist of multiple sub-sources with different emission strengths spread over a large area. Three different calculation approaches with different degree of details are presented for the combination of the individual sources in the bLS modelling: (i) A polygon over the entire WWTP area as a single source. (ii) All potential sources within the WWTP have a uniform emission density. (iii) Based on literature data, relative weighting of the individual sources is carried out. The maximum difference in emission between the most complex approach (iii) and the simplest approach (i) was 42 %. It could be shown that for large source areas ({ensuremath{>";2022;"methane, emissions, livestock, measurements, complex"

Assessment and mitigation of the risk of such events requires characterization of their weather/climate drivers and their spatial dependence. Here, we introduce a regionalization method that identifies coherent regions in which the likelihood of subseasonal TCEP exhibits similar dependence to large-scale dynamics. We apply this method to each season in the Northern Hemisphere using ERA5 reanalysis data. The analysis yields spatially coherent regions, primarily at high latitudes and along the eastern margins of ocean basins. We analyze the large-scale and synoptic conditions associated with TCEP in several of the identified regions, in light of three key ingredients: lifting, moisture availability, and persistence in synoptic conditions. We find that TCEP is often directly related to distinct cyclone and blocking frequency anomalies and upper-level wave patterns. Blocking and associated Rossby wave breaking are particularly relevant at high latitudes and midlatitudes. At upper levels, meridional wave patterns dominate; however, in western Europe and parts of North America, TCEP is sometimes associated with zonally extended wave patterns. The flow features associated with TCEP in the eastern Pacific and eastern Atlantic Oceans exhibit similarities. For some regions, moisture flux anomalies are present during clustering episodes whereas in others forced lifting alone is sufficient to trigger heavy precipitation. Our results provide new information on the dynamics and spatial dependence of TCEP that may be relevant for the subseasonal prediction of clustering episodes.";2022;"clustering, extreme, precipitation, spatial, dynamics"

We examine the case of Africa where the knowledge about major agricultural land transitions and the impacts on the quality of land is still very limited. A comprehensive assessment of change in agricultural landscapes was conducted at the African continental scale. We identify influencing factors and model the quality of land associated with agricultural land gains and losses between 2000 and 2018. Land quality was established based on spatially-explicit analysis of varying Net Primary Productivity, soil organic carbon content, crop suitability and percent yield change for major crops of global importance grown across Africa such as maize, rice, soybean, wheat, and alfalfa. Distance to settlements was important in explaining agricultural land dynamics. Most land areas that transitioned to cropland in Africa were associated with large distances away from major roads. Poor access to major roads suggests the remoteness of gained croplands. Land quality was better in gained croplands than in those lost, whereas gained grasslands were of lesser quality compared to areas of grassland loss. Five typologies of African countries were developed based on net yield and amount of land cultivated per crop in cropland change areas. Type 1 typifies net yield increase and cultivated land decrease, while type 2 is characterized by yield increase consequent upon cropland expansion. Net yield and land remain unchanged in type 3, while in type 4 cultivated land increased but yield decreased as in 40% of African countries for maize, and in type 5, both yield and land area decreased. This study thus provides evidence about the quality of land in gained and lost agricultural areas and generalizable insights on their dynamics across Africa.";2022;"agricultural, land, quality, africa, dynamics"

This recurrence leads to persistent surface anomalies and high-impact weather events. Here, we demonstrate the significance of RRWPs for persistent heatwaves in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). We investigate the relationship between RRWPs, atmospheric blocking, and amplified quasi-stationary Rossby waves with two cases of heatwaves in Southeast Australia (SEA) in 2004 and 2009. This region has seen extraordinary heatwaves in recent years. We also investigate the importance of transient systems such as RRWPs and two other persistent dynamical drivers: atmospheric blocks and quasi-resonant amplification (QRA). We further explore the link between RRWPs, blocks, and QRA in the SH using the ERA-I reanalysis dataset (1979?2018). We find that QRA and RRWPs are strongly associated: 40% of QRA days feature RRWPs, and QRA events are 13 times more likely to occur with an RRWPs event than without it. Furthermore, days with QRA and RRWPs show high correlations in the composite mean fields of upper-level flows, indicating that both features have a similar hemispheric flow configuration. Blocking frequencies for QRA and RRWP conditions both increase over the south Pacific Ocean but differ substantially over parts of the south Atlantic and Indian Ocean.";2022;"rrwps, heatwaves, southern, hemisphere, significance"

The case study's relevance stems from the fact that Switzerland, despite being a small country, shows a variety of hydro-climatological regimes, of water resources management challenges, and of hydrological research institutes that led to a model diversification that stands exemplary for the diversification that arose also at larger scales. Our analysis, based on literature review, personal inquiry, and an author survey, summarizes the main driving forces behind model diversification.

The essays in this volume take a critical look at universities across South Asia, more specifically, at the dynamics of student mobility and mobilizations existing in such localized social spaces, and compares these with their counterparts in universities across the world. While elite universities in South Asia, as elsewhere, have been caught in a stiff international competition and are aspiring for the highest ranks, students from the most excluded communities and remote parts of the country seek entry to badly endowed universities, facing obstacles during their courses, and upon seeking entry into employment. The volume evaluates such universities as spaces for mobility opportunity and mobilizations in a globally networked world.

In Laos, the government has started to question its own ?Turning Land into Capital? policy, and reviews land acquisitions or concessions with regard to their socioeconomic impacts. Empirical investigations of environmental impacts of land concessions, however, remain underrepresented. We link the nation-wide concession development between 2001 and 2017 with associated land use changes and quantify related land use change-induced emissions. Results show that land acquisitions for agriculture, forestry, and mining affect mainly forests and land previously used for shifting cultivation and permanent agriculture; e.g., rice paddies. Consequently, land conversions caused by concessions resulted in net carbon emissions of 4.9 Mt CO2e yr-1 on average in 2001?2017, which amounted to 34% of total emissions from land conversions. Even tree plantations that are meant to serve as net carbon sinks caused net emissions, but those data are the least robust. The relatively low carbon emission intensity of shifting cultivation compared to the high carbon emission intensity of concessions challenges the dominant narrative of shifting cultivation as a causal factor for forest degradation. Political means of fostering sustainable development include the reduction of land acquisitions because of their emissions intensity, and minimization of emissions and social conflict induced by granted concessions, for example, by allocating land with low carbon densities and obtaining consent of local land users.";2022;"land acquisitions, emissions, impacts, concessions, development"

This movement is strongly backed up by a network of transnational partnerships and has recently matured into an advocacy coalition that promotes an agroecological transition at national scale. In this article, we investigate the role of transnational links on the empowerment potential of agroecology. Combining the multi-level perspective of socio-technical transitions and Bourdieu's theory of practices, we conceptualize the agroecological network as a niche shaped by the circulation of different types of capital. Using social network analysis, we investigate the existing flows of resources and knowledge, as well as membership and advocacy links to critically address within-niche empowerment processes. We show that transnational ties play a key role in building the niche protective space, showing a financial dependency of the agroecological niche on NGOs and international cooperation programmes based in Europe and North America. This configuration tends to favor the empowerment of NGOs instead of farmer unions, which only play a peripheral role in the network. However, the multiple innovations focus of agroecology may open up prospects for more gradual but potentially radical change. Based on our findings, we suggest to include more explicitly core-periphery dynamics in transition studies involving North-South relations, including circulation of capital, ideas and norms.

There is concern, as insurance is a key safety net in contemporary life, that significant levels of house and contents underinsurance are placing individuals and communities at undue risk. Yet, the phenomenon of underinsurance is under-researched. Informed by a document analysis of findings from a multi-modal project investigating the experiences and perspectives of insured and uninsured households in bushfire-prone Australia, we identify underinsurance as a complex phenomenon that is variably co-constituted at different scales ? households, landscapes, and markets. To better understand what principles can be meaningfully applied for addressing underinsurance, we present four pertinent and novel themes ? place (contextualising rates of underinsurance), integration (integrating insurance with other disaster management mechanisms), hegemony (dismantling hegemonic risk discourses including reference to ?shared responsibility?), and solidarity (in insurance, and through disaster and climate responses). We conclude that addressing inequality and inequity remains paramount given the multifarious reasons why households may be underinsured. Strategies for addressing disasters and global environmental change should be socially just and inclusive irrespective of whether or not households have insurance.

However, in climate science the focus has partly shifted away from past seasonal and annual mean climate towards weather variability and extreme events. Weather events are more directly relevant for climate impacts and they capture the scale at which important processes take place. Weather reconstructions therefore help to better understand atmospheric processes, particularly during extreme events, to assess decadal-to-multidecadal climate variability through the lens of weather changes, and they allow impact modelling of past events. Consequently, attempts are currently undertaken to extend weather data sets far back into the past. In this review I discuss methods of weather reconstructions that are in use today. The methods range from expert analyses to data assimilation, from analog approaches to machine learning. Products range from weather types to four-dimensional fields. The methods complement each other as they are based on different assumptions and are based on different data sets. Weather reconstructions require more meteorological data than climate reconstructions. Additional data rescue efforts are therefore needed.";2022;"climate, weather, reconstructions, methods, impacts"

However, a challenge-oriented approach requires specific public sector capacities to coordinate and provide directionality, while having an innovation ecosystem with sufficient scientific and technological capabilities to address the grand societal challenges effectively.

An exploratory experimental application is conducted to examine and compare Italian regions facing four selected societal challenges (SCs): bioeconomy, climate change, health and inclusive, innovative and reflective societies. The findings show that the Italian regional readiness to address SCs is highly heterogeneous, going beyond the ?traditional? North-South divide. The index allows us to benchmark regional capacities for comparative analysis and to identify possible interregional synergies around specific SCs.

Bennett and Ruth Brennan and Lakshmi Charli-Joseph and Mar{'i";"Co-production, the collaborative weaving of research and practice by diverse societal actors, is argued to play an important role in sustainability transformations. Yet, there is still poor understanding of how to navigate the tensions that emerge in these processes. Through analyzing 32 initiatives worldwide that co-produced knowledge and action to foster sustainable social-ecological relations, we conceptualize ?co-productive agility? as an emergent feature vital for turning tensions into transformations. Co-productive agility refers to the willingness and ability of diverse actors to iteratively engage in reflexive dialogues to grow shared ideas and actions that would not have been possible from the outset. It relies on embedding knowledge production within processes of change to constantly recognize, reposition, and navigate tensions and opportunities. Co-productive agility opens up mul- tiple pathways to transformation through: (1) elevating marginalized agendas in ways that maintain their integrity and broaden struggles for justice; (2) questioning dominant agendas by engaging with power in ways that challenge assumptions, (3) navigating conflicting agendas to actively transform interlinked paradigms, practices, and structures; (4) exploring diverse agendas to foster learning and mutual respect for a plurality of perspectives. We explore six process considerations that vary by these four pathways and provide a framework to enable agility in sustainability transformations. We argue that research and practice spend too much time closing down debate over different agendas for change ? thereby avoiding, suppressing, or polarizing tensions, and call for more efforts to facilitate better interactions among different agendas.";2022;"co-production, sustainability, agility, transformation, diversity"

A large ensemble of 12 general circulation models (GCMs) from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) that are dynamically downscaled by five regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional-climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)-Africa is used. In total, 43 RCM?GCM combinations are considered under three representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5). The reliability of each of the climate datasets is first evaluated with satellite and reanalysis reference datasets. Subsequently, the Rank Resampling for Distributions and Dependences (R2D2) multivariate bias correction method is applied to the climate datasets. The bias-corrected climate projections are then used as input to the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) for hydrological projections over the 21st century (1991?2100).  Results reveal contrasting dynamics in the seasonality of rainfall, depending on the selected greenhouse gas emission scenarios and the future projection periods. Although air temperature and potential evaporation increase under all RCPs, an increase in the magnitude of all hydrological variables (actual evaporation, total runoff, groundwater recharge, soil moisture, and terrestrial water storage) is only projected under RCP8.5. High- and low-flow analysis suggests an increased flood risk under RCP8.5, particularly in the Black Volta, while hydrological droughts would be recurrent under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5, particularly in the White Volta. The evolutions of streamflow indicate a future delay in the date of occurrence of low flows up to 11-d under RCP8.5, while high flows could occur 6-d earlier (RCP2.6) or 5-d later (RCP8.5), as compared to the historical period.  Disparities are observed in the spatial patterns of hydroclimatic variables across climatic zones, with higher warming in the Sahelian zone. Therefore, climate change would have severe implications for future water availability with concerns for rain-fed agriculture, thereby weakening the water?energy?food security nexus and amplifying the vulnerability of the local population. The variability between climate models highlights uncertainties in the projections and indicates a need to better represent complex climate features in regional models. These findings could serve as a guideline for both the scientific community to improve climate change projections and for decision-makers to elaborate adaptation and mitigation strategies to cope with the consequences of climate change and strengthen regional socioeconomic development.";2022;"climate, water, impact, west africa, projections"

The daily maximum TW can be effectively used in monitoring humid heat waves and their effects on health. Because meteorological stations differ in temporal resolution and are susceptible to non-climatic influences, it is difficult to provide complete and homogeneous long-term series. In this study, based on the sub-daily station-based HadISD (Met Office Hadley Centre Integrated Surface Database) dataset and integrating the NCEP-DOE reanalysis dataset, the daily maximum TW series of 1834 stations that have passed quality control were homogenized and reconstructed using the method of Climatol. These stations form a new dataset of global station-based daily maximum TW (GSDM-WBT) from 1981 to 2020. Compared with other station-based and reanalysis-based datasets of TW, the average bias was ?0.48 and 0.34-?C, respectively. The GSDM-WBT dataset handles stations with many missing values and possible inhomogeneities, and also avoids the underestimation of the TW calculated from reanalysis data. The GSDM-WBT dataset can effectively support the research on global or regional extreme heat events and humid heat waves.

Such wildfires produce uncontainable, airborne, and hazardous smoke, which potentially carries radioactive material, thus becoming the specter of the original disaster. As wildfires occur more frequently with climate change and land use changes, nuclear wildfires present a pressing yet little discussed problem among wildfire management and fire scholars. The problem requires urgent attention due to the risks it poses to the health and wellbeing of wildland firefighters, land stewards, and smoke-impacted communities.

The Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, imposed after the accident, remains one of the most contaminated areas in the world today. Over a thousand wildfires have burnt inside the Zone since it was established, raising international concern that combustion from a high-intensity wildfire will rerelease radioisotopes currently held in the vegetation and soil. This chapter focuses on the wildfires that blazed in the Zone in the spring of 2020. To understand the lingering effects and insurance implications of the Chornobyl disaster, volumetric understandings of sovereign power and territory are required. Equally, the affective atmospheres of the subsequent wildfires require attention in order to understand the impacts of such atmospheric events. This chapter, therefore, brings ideas regarding affective atmospheres, sensing assemblages, and volumetric sovereignty from human geography and cognate disciplines into conversation with insurance studies. We think through the insurantial consequences of events that are not bound by two-dimensional cartographies, and that transcend geopolitical borders in space and time.";2022;"chornobyl, wildfires, contamination, sovereignty, insurance"

However, where inadequately protected, human-induced forest fragmentation can degrade them and reduce their functioning. Therefore, monitoring forests in protected areas is essential to ascertain their protection. This paper assesses forest fragmentation in the Cross River National Park, a biodiversity hotspot in the tropical rainforest of Nigeria. Forest fragmentation was analyzed using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework. Fragmentation analysis of the State used class-level pattern metrics on Landsat and Sentinel images from the years 2000, 2015 and 2020. Forest fragmentation has reduced total forest area, decreased average size of forest patches, increased the number of forest patches and amount of edge. Only the isolation of forest patches has not yet reached a measurable intensity. However, spatio-temporal forest fragmentation over the years 2000, 2015 and 2020 indicates a rising trend, especially between 2015 and 2020. The Drivers, Pressures, Impacts and Responses were investigated through a systematic literature review. Many studies show that the main proximate Drivers of forest fragmentation are agricultural activities mainly by the local communities, demand for forest resources by the growing population, and by external actors through illegal logging and infrastructure building, which have increased. However, wider literature highlight issues of disproportionately blaming local resource users, and the need to examine the neglect of justice, rights and local values, and their implications for sustainable protected areas. Reported Impacts include hindered migration of the endangered Cross River gorilla and impaired ecosystem services like water cycling, carbon sequestration and disease regulation. Responses have generally excluded the local communities, have failed or are yet to become effective. There is thus a need to identify, together with the involved actors, why measures have failed and to implement more sustainable options to reduce fragmentation in the park while addressing local users? needs.";2022;"protected, intact, biodiversity, forest, fragmentation"

For that, probability distribution and density functions of the lapse rate and the potential temperature gradients from 10 years of measurement data from the MOZAIC/IAGOS project and ERA5 reanalysis data were produced, and an analysis of an example case of an ice-supersaturated region with a large vertical extent is performed. For the study of the probability distribution and density functions, a distinction is made between ice-subsaturated and ice-supersaturated air masses (persistent contrails) and situations of particularly high ice supersaturation that allow the formation of optically thick and strongly warming contrails. The estimation of the lapse rates involves two adjacent standard pressure levels of the reanalysis surrounding MOZAIC's measurement/flight points. If the upper of these levels is in the stratosphere, the distribution function for subsaturated cases shows much lower lapse rates than those of supersaturated cases. If all levels are in the troposphere, the distributions become more similar, but the average lapse rates are still higher in supersaturated than in subsaturated cases, and the distributions peak at higher values and are narrower in ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs) than elsewhere. This narrowing is particularly pronounced if there is substantial supersaturation.  For the examination of an example case, ERA5 data and forecasts from ICON-EU (DWD) are compared. ERA5 data, in particular, show a large ice-supersaturated region below the tropopause, which was pushed up by uplifting air, while the data of ICON-EU indicate areas of saturation. The lapse rate in this ice-supersaturated region (ISSR), which is large, is associated with clouds and high relative humidity. Supersaturation and cloud formation result from uplifting of air layers. The temperature gradient within an uplifting layer steepens, for both dry and moist air. As soon as condensation or ice formation starts in the upper part of a lifting layer, the release of latent heat begins to decrease the lapse rate, but radiation starts to act in the opposite direction, keeping the lapse rate high. The highest lapse rates close to the stability limit can only be reached in potentially unstable situations.";2022;"ice, lapse, supersaturation, clouds, potential"

This introductory article has three objectives: first, based on a broad literature review, we aim to identify four key forces, as well as the fundamental relatively stable capitalist logics contributing to the complex reconfiguration of global economic activities. Second, we will position the papers included in this special issue against the four main forces identified and discuss the contributions of each article to capture some emerging cross-paper patterns among them.

While strategic coupling is a useful concept for understanding local-global economic dynamics, the idea that a region can simultaneously couple into multiple production networks organised at different spatial scales and that regional actors can increase their autonomy by creatively combining different coupling scenarios has been little explored. This paper explores how regional institutional innovations can facilitate such multiple couplings. We focus on the industrial chain chief model in China?s Zhejiang province, which emerged against the backdrop of the U.S.-China trade war and the COVID-19 pandemic. We argue that this institutional innovation offers a different way of thinking for regions that have long been exposed to the influence of globalisation, and that it increases the agency of local actors in global production networks.";2022;"global economy, competitive, resilient, regional, institutional"

Although arsenic is often considered toxic, it can exist in food as more than 300 chemical species with different toxicities. This diversity makes it difficult for food safety and health authorities to regulate arsenic levels in food, which are currently based on a few arsenic species. Of particular interest are arsenolipids, a type of arsenic species widely found in seafood. Emerging evidence indicates that there are risks associated with human exposure to arsenolipids (e.g., accumulation in breast milk, ability to cross the blood?brain barrier and accumulate in the brain, and potential development of neurodegenerative disorders). Still, more research is needed to fully understand the impact of arsenolipid exposure, which requires establishing interdisciplinary collaborations.";2022;"arsenic, exposure, food, safety, research"

"545";"Comparing types and patterns: A context-oriented approach to densification in Switzerland and the Netherlands";"Vera G{\"o";"While governments worldwide develop policies to promote urban densification, critics point to possible negative effects of densification on social sustainability. The occurrence and distribution of these negative social effects are strongly influenced by land policies. This makes it crucial to monitor the role of land policies and understand what processes shape urban development in the context of densification. To do so, detailed, large-scale international comparisons of densification patterns, including building and social changes, are needed. We address this issue by introducing a method to measure and compare urban development in two countries with contrasting planning systems: the Netherlands, where public actors play a strong and active role, and Switzerland, where strong private property titles and a highly democratic planning system are prevailing. Our GIS-based method analyses densification processes within their surrounding morphological and socio-demographic context. A k-proto cluster analysis on highly detailed spatial and statistical data based on housing units, covering 2011?2019, results in five densification types. The distribution of these types reveals different patterns in the two city regions of Utrecht (NL) and Bern (CH). Most strikingly, contiguous redevelopments frequently occurred in Utrecht but hardly in Bern, pointing at possible advantages for Dutch municipalities to intervene in property rights. While having developed an empirical basis in this study, future research that refines the analysis of the legal, planning and ownership conditions underlying the identified densification patterns can contribute significantly to policy evaluation.";2022;"urban, densification, social, land, policies"

LGBTQIA+ peoples' vulnerability is shaped by social marginalisation, discrimination, and stigma, and exacerbated by dominant value systems and Western heteronormative framings of disaster experiences. We present a review of scholarship into gender and sexual minorities and disasters. We summarise extant knowledge and identify areas for growth in the field of disaster geographies. We argue that progress requires increased conceptual and methodological focus on diversity and the intersectional factors that exacerbate marginality, more inclusive knowledge production pathways focussed on risk reduction, and establishing methods for LGBTQIA+ people to be involved in research about them. More critical and inclusive research will not only aid progress in disaster geographies; it will also provide vital evidence with which to lobby policymakers and disaster management to pay closer attention to diversity and inclusion. By moving beyond normativity, cisgender-heterosexual assumptions, and homogenising identity labels, we can begin to address social, cultural, and political factors that determine spatial inequalities, marginalisation, and disaster vulnerability for gender and sexual minorities.";2022;"gender, minorities, disaster, inclusion, research"
"549";"Farmer surveys in Europe suggest that specialized, intensive farms were more likely to perceive negative impacts from COVID-19.";"Julian Helfenstein and Matthias B{\"u";"It has been shown that the COVID-19 pandemic affected some agricultural systems more than others, and even within geographic regions, not all farms were affected to the same extent. To build resilience of agricultural systems to future shocks, it is key to understand which farms were affected and why. In this study, we examined farmers' perceived robustness to COVID-19, a key resilience capacity. We conducted standardized farmer interviews (n = 257) in 15 case study areas across Europe, covering a large range of socio-ecological contexts and farm types. Interviews targeted perceived livelihood impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on productivity, sales, price, labor availability, and supply chains in 2020, as well as farm(er) characteristics and farm management. Our study corroborates earlier evidence that most farms were not or only slightly affected by the first wave(s) of the pandemic in 2020, and that impacts varied widely by study region. However, a significant minority of farmers across Europe reported that the pandemic was \"the worst crisis in a lifetime\" (3%) or \"the worst crisis in a decade\" (7%). Statistical analysis showed that more specialized and intensive farms were more likely to have perceived negative impacts. From a societal perspective, this suggests that highly specialized, intensive farms face higher vulnerability to shocks that affect regional to global supply chains. Supporting farmers in the diversification of their production systems while decreasing dependence on service suppliers and supply chain actors may increase their robustness to future disruptions.

"550";"Analogue Methods and ERA5: Benefits and Pitfalls";"Pascal Horton";"Perfect prognosis statistical downscaling relies on the statistical relationships established using observational data for predictands and predictors. Predictors are often retrieved from reanalyses, which are considered pseudo-observations. The impact of the choice of a reanalysis dataset on the performance of the downscaling method is usually overlooked, as global reanalyses are frequently assumed to be equivalent for the last few decades and data-rich regions such as Europe. However, it was recently shown that the reanalysis dataset can have a bigger impact on the method skill than the choice of predictor variables. Generally, reanalyses processed by more recent atmospheric models assimilate more data and perform best.  This work is aimed at assessing the extent of potential gains from the use of ERA5, following its release, compared to other global reanalyses. The assessment was carried out using six variants of analog methods, which are statistical downscaling techniques, to predict daily precipitation at 301 stations across Switzerland. ERA5 proved to be one of the best performing reanalyses across the different analog methods. Due to data availability, we recommend using 20CR for applications starting between 1851 and 1900, CERA-20C for those between 1900 and 1950, and ERA5 for applications after 1950.  However, ERA5 high spatial resolution (0.25?) turned out to be a trap for simple calibration techniques. The domains over which the predictor fields are compared need to be optimized, and high-resolution grids come along with numerous sub-optimal local solutions. An enhanced calibration procedure, thus, must be used. Besides the risk of poorly-calibrated domains, the high resolution also requires much higher computational time with no gain in skill, provided that the predictors considered are relevant at a synoptic scale. Although ERA5 should be the dataset of choice, its use at a lower resolution to predict daily precipitation should provide equivalent performance.";2022;"prognosis, downscaling, reanalysis, predictors, performance"

This is due to a disconnect between point or transect scale albedo sampling and the coarser spatial, spectral and/or temporal resolutions of available satellite products. Here, we present time-series of bare-ice surface reflectance data that span a range of length scales, from the 500 m for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer?s MOD10A1 product, to 10 m for Sentinel-2 imagery, 0.1 m spot measurements from ground-based field spectrometry, and 2.5 cm from uncrewed aerial drone imagery. Our results reveal broad similarities in seasonal patterns in bare-ice reflectance, but further analysis identifies short-term dynamics in reflectance distribution that are unique to each dataset. Using these distributions, we demonstrate that areal mean reflectance is the primary control on local ablation rates, and that the spatial distribution of specific ice types and impurities is secondary. Given the rapid changes in mean reflectance observed in the datasets presented, we propose that albedo parameterizations can be improved by (i) quantitative assessment of the representativeness of time-averaged reflectance data products, and, (ii) using temporally-resolved functions to describe the variability in impurity distribution at daily time-scales. We conclude that the regional melt model performance may not be optimally improved by increased spatial resolution and the incorporation of sub-pixel heterogeneity, but instead, should focus on the temporal dynamics of bare-ice albedo.";2022;"ice, reflectance, data, dynamics, melt"

The concept of challenge-oriented regional innovation systems (CoRISs) is employed to cast light on how RISs can be reconfigured in response to societal challenges. Based on the articles in this issue, the editorial distinguishes between two routes into which CoRISs could be developed: RIS reorientation strategies versus RIS transformation strategies. The first strategy assumes that at least some place-specific problems that are related to grand societal challenges can be tackled by use of existing assets, actors and institutions in historically grown RISs. RIS transformation strategies go a step further. They emphasize disruption and the strategic creation of new RIS elements. These include the inclusion of new innovative actors and actor groups, the implementations of institutional change, and also the disruption of old network linkages and the establishment of new ones.

Indeed, the giant connected component is not relevant and instead, we propose to partition the road network in terms of accessibility of local towns and define new measures that characterize the impact of the flooding event.

However, it is often unclear whether these land-use changes are part of broader land system regime shifts in which pre-existing production systems and livelihood strategies are fundamentally transformed along with observable land-use changes rather than simply displaced or eliminated. This is a critical social-environment question given that regime shifts are often a desired and intended outcome of national rural development and market-liberalization policies but must also be attentive to environmental conservation and/or climate change mitigation goals. We investigated whether nationally extensive land-use changes implemented through large-scale land deals in Lao People?s Democratic Republic resulted in full, partial, or no village- and landscape-level regime shifts in and around land deals. Overall, land deals triggered a wide variety of full, partial, and no regime shift outcomes. Land deals with both domestic and foreign investors produced positive and negative outcomes, although foreign land deals for the production of rubber led to significantly higher rates of indirect land-use change in impacted villages than domestic and/or non-rubber land deals. Also, financial compensation alone was insufficient to improve community well-being because it could be reinvested to perpetuate previous land uses without the desired transformation in livelihoods and rural development. Land deals that exhibited greater social embeddedness (i.e., provided adequate compensation complemented by job-creation and improved access to infrastructure and/or services) were more likely to lead to positive regime shifts. Our findings demonstrate that any land system regime shift will produce both winners and losers, and thus it becomes necessary to critically analyze the localized distribution of social and environmental costs and benefits within broader-scale land-use regime shifts.";2022;"land-use, regime, shifts, land, deals"

In Australia, fire has shaped culture, traditions, and national identity. Yet, the fiery future that is emerging questions people's ability to insure against growing losses. High-fire-danger days and uncontrollable fire behaviour are increasing as a result of climate change and unsustainable land management practices. More people are building and living in amenity-rich but fire-prone landscapes. A grim picture of un- and under-insurance has already been revealed. Still, some bushfire survivors describe a re-evaluated relationship to material possessions post-fire. This raises questions about what is valuable, and to whom? How can we understand ?adequate? insurance levels in more than monetary terms? The chapter shows how the difference between the absence and presence of material belongings cannot always be defined by a monetary value replaceable by insurance pay-outs. Rather, it is an emotional presence that continues despite its physical absence. Time, emotional, and physical labour are currencies that often hold as much value to survivors as the financial promise of an insurance policy. Yet, these currencies hold little value in the eyes of insurance assessors. The chapter concludes that in the context of the material and emotional resources that define people's complex everyday lives, the value of insurance is what people make it.";2022;"value, bushfire, australia, insurance, survivors"

The use of the stable isotopes of water as a natural tracer has become popular over recent years to characterize water flow paths and storage in such environments, in conjunction with electric conductivity (EC) and water temperature measurements. In this work, we analyzed in detail the potential of year round samples of these natural tracers to characterize hydrological processes in a snow-dominated Alpine catchment. Our results underline that water temperature measurements in springs, groundwater and in-stream are promising to trace flow path depth and relative flow rates. The stable isotopes of water are shown here to be particularly valuable to get insights into the interplay of subsurface flow and direct snowmelt input to the stream during winter and early snow melt periods. Our results underline the critical role of subsurface flow during all melt periods and the presence of snowmelt even during winter base flow. We furthermore discuss why reliably detecting the role of subsurface flow requires year-round water sampling in such environments. A key conclusion of our work is the added value of soil and water temperature measurements to interpret EC and isotope analyses, by giving additional information on snow-free periods and on flow path depths.";2022;"hydrological, processes, stable isotopes, snow, temperature"

Drawing on the insights from two international workshops on archetype analysis and on broader literature on validity, we propose a framework that identifies and describes six dimensions of validity: conceptual; construct; internal; external; empirical; and application validity. We first discuss the six dimensions in relation to different methodological approaches and purposes of archetype analysis. We then present an operational use of the framework for researchers to assess the validity of archetype analysis and to support sound archetype identification and policy-relevant applications. Finally, we apply our assessment to 18 published archetype analyses, which we use to describe the challenges and insights in validating the different dimensions and suggest ways to holistically improve the validity of identified archetypes. With this, we contribute to more rigorous archetype analyses, helping to develop the potential of the approach for guiding sustainability solutions.";2022;"archetype, sustainability, validity, framework, analysis"
"588";"Estimating Regional Snow Line Elevation Using Public Webcam Images";"C{'e";"Snow cover is of high relevance for the Earth?s climate system, and its variability plays a key role in alpine hydrology, ecology, and socioeconomic systems. Measurements obtained by optical satellite remote sensing are an essential source for quantifying snow cover variability from a local to global scale. However, the temporal resolution of such measurements is often affected by persistent cloud coverage, limiting the application of high resolution snow cover mapping. In this study, we derive the regional snow line elevation in an alpine catchment area using public webcams. We compare our results to the snow line information derived from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-2 snow cover products and find our results to be in good agreement therewith. Between October 2017 and the end of June 2018, snow lines derived from webcams lie on average 55.8 m below and 33.7 m above MODIS snow lines using a normalized-difference snow index (NDSI) of 0.4 and 0.1, respectively, and are on average 53.1 m below snow lines derived from Sentinel-2. We further analyze the superior temporal resolution of webcam-based snow cover information and demonstrate its effectiveness in filling temporal gaps in satellite-based measurements caused by cloud cover. Our findings show the ability of webcam-based snow line elevation retrieval to complement and improve satellite-based measurements.";2022;"snow, satellite, resolution, webcam, elevation"

Mitigation of these hazards includes the construction of check dams, which limit coarse sediment transport and in the European Alps number in the 100,000s. Check dam functionality depends on periodic, costly maintenance, but maintenance is not always possible and check dams often fail. As such, there is a need to quantify the long-term (10?100 years) geomorphic response of rivers to check dam failures. Here, for the first time, a landscape evolution model (CAESAR-Lisflood) driven by a weather generator is used to replicate check dam failures due to the lack of maintenance, check dam age, and flood occurrence. The model is applied to the Guerbe River, Switzerland, a pre-Alpine catchment containing 73 check dams that undergo simulated failure. Also presented is a novel method to calibrate CAESAR-Lisflood?s hydrological component on this ungauged catchment. Using 100-year scenarios of check dam failure, the model indicates that check dam failures can produce 8 m of channel erosion and a 322% increase in sediment yield. The model suggests that after check dam failure, channel erosion is the remobilization of deposits accumulated behind check dams, and, after a single check dam failure channel equilibrium occurs in five years, but after many check dam failures channel equilibrium may not occur until 15 years. Overall, these findings support the continued maintenance of check dams.";2022;"debris, hazards, check, dams, failures"

The conflation of competence with masculinity is revealed to have negative impacts on wellbeing for all members of mountain and wildland professions, including harassment and discrimination, and increased suicide rates for cis-males. Notably, this includes negative impacts to team decision making, risk management, safety, and inclusion. Ultimately, the authors expose ?masculinity as competence? to be a socio-cultural myth.

We find that asynchronous behaviour of mass balance between the regions has become very likely since the early 2000s, exceeding the range of previous decadal variability. Related tropospheric circulation exhibits more meridional patterns, a greater influence of meridional heat advection and a wavier summer circulation. The traceable impact on glacier mass balances emphasizes the importance of dynamic next to thermodynamic climate changes for the future of glacier mass loss, Arctic ecology and societal impacts.";2022;"glaciers, arctic, climate, mass loss, circulation"

How trees acclimate to long-term soil moisture changes and whether these long-term changes alter trees? sensitivity to short-term (day to months) variations of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture is largely unknown. Leaf gas exchange measurements were performed within a long-term (17 years) irrigation experiment in a drought-prone Scots pine-dominated forest in one of Switzerland?s driest areas on trees in naturally dry (control), irrigated, and ?irrigation-stop? (after 11 years of irrigation) conditions. Seventeen years of irrigation increased photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance (gs) and reduced gs sensitivity to increasing VPD and soil drying. Following irrigation-stop, gas exchange decreased only after 3 years. After 5 years, maximum carboxylation (Vcmax) and electron transport (Jmax) rates in irrigation-stop recovered to similar levels as to before the irrigation-stop. These results suggest that long-term release from soil drought reduces the sensitivity to VPD and that atmospheric constraints may play an increasingly important role in combination with soil drought. Moreover, our study indicates that structural adjustments lead to an attenuation of initially strong leaf-level acclimation to strong multiple-year drought.";2022;"climate, trees, acclimate, drought, gas exchange"

Findings indicate that both CF and SML have positive socio-economic impacts, though these are generally short-lived. Long-term impacts are mixed, with economic returns sustained by degradation of the resource base and largely captured downstream. From an environmental point of view, the complexity of the regulatory framework to establish CFs, their location in a ?non-permanent forest domain?, and the lack of extension services supporting the local populations in implementation, in parallel with the rapidly increasing demand for wood on the domestic market, indicate that CFs also fail on many criteria of sustainable forest management.";2022;"community, forests, logging, sustainable, management"

One example is the successive occurrence of extreme precipitation events over sub-seasonal timescales, referred to as temporal clustering. Its potential effects on discharge have received little attention. Here, we address this topic by analysing discharge observations following extreme precipitation events either clustered in time or occurring in isolation. We rely on two sets of precipitation and discharge data, one centred on Switzerland and the other over Europe. We identify ?clustered? extreme precipitation events based on the previous occurrence of another extreme precipitation within a given time window. We find that clustered events are generally followed by a more prolonged discharge response with a larger amplitude. The probability of exceeding the 95th discharge percentile in 5-d following an extreme precipitation event is in particular up to twice as high for situations where another extreme precipitation event occurred in the preceding week compared to isolated extreme precipitation events. The influence of temporal clustering on discharge decreases as the clustering window increases; beyond 6?8 weeks the difference in discharge response with non-clustered events is negligible. Catchment area, streamflow regime and precipitation magnitude also modulate the response. The impact of clustering is generally smaller in snow-dominated and large catchments. Additionally, particularly persistent periods of high discharge tend to occur in conjunction with temporal clusters of precipitation extremes.";2022;"impact, precipitation, discharge, clustering, response"

They benefit from estimating past climate states from both observation information and from model simulations. The first monthly global paleo-reanalysis (EKF400) was generated over the 1600 and 2005 time period, and it provides estimates of several atmospheric fields. Here we present a new, considerably improved version of EKF400 (EKF400v2). EKF400v2 uses atmospheric-only general circulation model simulations with a greatly extended observational network of early instrumental temperature and pressure data, documentary evidences and tree-ring width and density proxy records. Furthermore, new observation types such as monthly precipitation amounts, number of wet days and coral proxy records were also included in the assimilation. In the version 2 system, the assimilation process has undergone methodological improvements such as the background-error covariance matrix is estimated with a blending technique of a time-dependent and a climatological covariance matrices. In general, the applied modifications resulted in enhanced reconstruction skill compared to version 1, especially in precipitation, sea-level pressure and other variables beside the mostly assimilated temperature data, which already had high quality in the previous version. Additionally, two case studies are presented to demonstrate the applicability of EKF400v2 to analyse past climate variations and extreme events, as well as to investigate large-scale climate dynamics.";2022;"data assimilation, climate reconstruction, improved version, observational network, enhanced reconstruction"

"611";"Meteorological Conditions That Promote Persistent Contrails";"Lena Wilhelm and Klaus Gierens and Susanne Rohs";"Climate-impacting contrails need ice (super-)saturation to persist longer than a few minutes. However, this simple criterion cannot be easily applied for the prediction of persistent contrails. The current weather forecast models, which lack humidity data for assimilation in the upper troposphere, have difficulties coping with the enormous variability and sharp gradients in the relative humidity field. Thus, ice supersaturation, which is an extremal state of relative humidity, is hard to forecast at a precise location and time to allow contrail-avoiding flight routing. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of using dynamical proxy variables for improved contrail prediction. This idea is guided by the fact that the probability of ice supersaturation differs in different dynamical regimes. Therefore, we determine probability distributions of temperature, water vapour concentration, vertical velocity, divergence, relative and potential vorticity, geopotential height, and lapse rate conditioned on three situations: (a) contrail persistence not possible; (b) contrail persistence possible; and (c) strongly warming persistent contrails possible. While the atmospheric variables are taken from reanalysis data, the conditions (a?c) are based on airborne measurement data and radiation quantities from the reanalysis. It turns out that the vorticity variables, and in particular geopotential and lapse rate, show quite distinct conditional probabilities, suggesting a possibility to base an improved forecast of persistent contrails not only on the traditional quantities of temperature and relative humidity, but on these dynamical proxies as well. Furthermore, we show the existence of long flight tracks with the formation of strongly warming contrails, which are probably embedded in larger ice-supersaturated regions with conditions that foster such contrails. For forecasting purposes, this is a beneficial property since the humidity forecast is easier on large, rather than small, spatial scales.";2022;"climate, supersaturation, dynamical, contrail, forecast"

Whereas numerous studies have focused on diversifying and decolonizing geography through recruitment practices, mentoring, and knowledge production, only a few have analyzed how diversity translates into teaching practices, particularly in contexts where diversity is relatively well-established among staff. Based on a questionnaire survey among the teaching staff, a content analysis of course syllabi, and a quantitative analysis of the department?s employee data, this article explores to what extent diversity within the department leads to diversity in teaching practices. By developing a framework of spaces of diversity, we analyze three spaces that potentially enable practicing diversity in teaching: The department?s academic space promotes free choice of research and teaching topics and flexible working conditions; the department space enables individuals to engage in shaping geographical teaching; and the knowledge space promotes diversity as an ideal.

Data were drawn from 29 interviews with the involved actors. Our results show that social innovations in tourism that overcame the tipping point fulfil three conditions: First, new actors join the social innovations in the operating phase. second, all the actors involved benefit from the social innovation for their own business strategy. third, the social innovation is accepted in the region and among the actors involved and therefore does not face strong headwinds. Furthermore, developers, supporters, and promoters are important throughout the entire social innovation process. the findings sug- gest the need for a more comprehensive understanding of inno- vations in tourism that incorporates the complexity of different actors involved.";2022;"innovations, actors, tipping, region, challenges"
"616";"The Role of Atmospheric Blocking in Regulating Arctic Warming";"Cheng You and Michael Tjernstr{\"o";"Using ERA5 reanalysis we find positive trends in poleward transport of moisture and heat during 1979?2018 over the winter Barents Sea sector and summer East Siberian Sea sector. The increase in blocking occurrence (blocking days) can explain these trends. Blocking occurrence over the Barents Sea sector significantly increased in the last 40 winters, inducing increasingly stronger poleward transport of moisture and heat. The high linear correlation between poleward energy transports and temperature over the Barents Sea sector suggests that poleward energy transports dominate the regional warming trend there. Meanwhile, in summer, more frequently occurring blocking over the Beaufort Sea sector causes a positive trend of poleward moist and heat transport over the East Siberian Sea sector. The high linear correlation between the blocking occurrence and temperature suggests that the increasing shortwave radiation and subsidence within the more frequently occurring blocking contribute to the regional warming trend.";2022;"trends, poleward, transport, blocking, temperature"

In this context, ecoregions and biomes, merely defined on the basis of their biophysical features, are incomplete characterizations of the territory. Land system science requires classification schemes that incorporate both social and biophysical dimensions. In this study, we generated spatially explicit social-ecological land system (SELS) typologies for South America with a hybrid methodology that combined data-driven spatial analysis with a knowledge-based evaluation by an interdisciplinary group of regional specialists. Our approach embraced a holistic consideration of the social-ecological land systems, gathering a dataset of 26 variables spanning across 7 dimensions: physical, biological, land cover, economic, demographic, political, and cultural. We identified 13 SELS nested in 5 larger social-ecological regions (SER). Each SELS was discussed and described by specific groups of specialists. Although 4 environmental and 1 socioeconomic variable explained most of the distribution of the coarse SER classification, a diversity of 15 other variables were shown to be essential for defining several SELS, highlighting specific features that differentiate them. The SELS spatial classification presented is a systematic and operative characterization of South American social-ecological land systems. We propose its use can contribute as a reference framework for a wide range of applications such as analyzing observations within larger contexts, designing system-specific solutions for sustainable development, and structuring hypothesis testing and comparisons across space.

Therefore, we developed SlideforMAP, a probabilistic model that allows for a regional assessment of shallow-landslide probability while considering the effect of different scenarios of forest cover, forest management and rainfall intensity. SlideforMAP uses a probabilistic approach by distributing hypothetical landslides to uniformly random- ized coordinates in a 2D space. The surface areas for these hypothetical landslides are derived from a distribution func- tion calibrated on observed events. For each generated land- slide, SlideforMAP calculates a factor of safety using the limit equilibrium approach. Relevant soil parameters are as- signed to the generated landslides from log-normal distribu- tions based on mean and standard deviation values represen- tative of the study area. The computation of the degree of soil saturation is implemented using a stationary flow ap- proach and the topographic wetness index. The root rein- forcement is computed by root proximity and root strength derived from single-tree-detection data. The ratio of unstable landslides to the number of generated landslides, per raster cell, is calculated and used as an index for landslide proba- bility. We performed a calibration of SlideforMAP for three test areas in Switzerland with a reliable landslide inventory by randomly generating 1000 combinations of model param- eters and then maximizing the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operation curve. The test areas are located in mountainous areas ranging from 0.5?7.5 km2 with mean slope gradients from 18?28?. The density of inventoried his- torical landslides varies from 5?59 slides km?2. AUC values between 0.64 and 0.93 with the implementation of single-tree detection indicated a good model performance. A qualitative sensitivity analysis indicated that the most relevant param- eters for accurate modelling of shallow-landslide probabil- ity are the soil thickness, soil cohesion and the precipitation intensity / transmissivity ratio. Furthermore, we show that the inclusion of single-tree detection improves overall model performance compared to assumptions of uniform vegeta- tion. In conclusion, our study shows that the approach used in SlideforMAP can reproduce observed shallow-landslide oc- currence at a catchment scale.";2022;"risk, landslides, model, soil, calibration"

There is, however, limited understanding about how the common global drivers of land use change induce different forms of agricultural investment and produce different impacts on the ground. This article provides a cross-country comparative analysis of how differences in business models, land use changes, and governance systems explain differences in socio-economic, food security, and environmental impacts of LAIs in Kenya, Madagascar, and Mozambique. It brings together results on these aspects generated in the AFGROLAND project that collected data in a multi-method approach via household surveys, business model surveys, semi-structured household interviews, life-cycle assessments of farm production, analysis of remote-sensing data, key informant interviews, and document analysis. For the present project synthesis, we combined a collaborative expert workshop with a comparative analysis of 16 LAIs. The results show that the LAIs follow four distinctive impact patterns, ranging from widespread adverse impacts to moderate impacts. Results demonstrate how the following conditions influence how the global drivers of land use change translate into different LAIs and different impacts on the ground: labor intensity, prior land use, utilization of land, farm size, type of production, experience in local agriculture, land tenure security, accountability of state and local elites, the mobilization capacity of civil society, expansion of resource frontiers, agricultural intensification, and indirect land use change. The results indicate that commercial agriculture can be a component in sustainable development strategies under certain conditions, but that these strategies will fail without substantial, sustained increases in the economic viability and inclusiveness of smallholder agriculture, land tenure security, agro-ecological land management, and support for broader patterns of endogenous agrarian transformation.";2021;"agricultural, investments, impacts, land, analysis"

In deep, stratified lakes, eutrophication-induced hypolimnetic anoxia often stimulates the release of labile P from the sediment into the water column. This positive feedback, termed internal P loading, maintains or even accelerates eutrophication. However, most studies on internal P loading have focused on recent times. Little is known about whether such positive feedbacks caused by labile P release from sediments also played a role under natural conditions with little or no human impact. We investigated a high-resolution 15,000-year sediment record of paleoproduction, anoxia, and five sedimentary P fractions from a small, deep lake, Soppensee, on the Swiss Central Plateau. We estimated long-term qualitative internal P loading by comparing the Holocene record of diatom-inferred epilimnetic total P (DI-TP) concentrations with labile P fraction (Fesingle bondP) concentrations in sediments under changing trophic state, redox, and lake mixing regimes. Intensified P cycling from sediments into the water column (enhanced internal P loading) apparently occurred as a positive feedback to natural eutrophication with persistent bottom-water anoxia during the early to mid-Holocene ({texttt{char126";2021;"cultural, eutrophication, phosphorus, sediments, anoxia"

Thousands of fishers lose their lives on the lake every year. While deadly waves are assumed to be initiated by severe wind gusts, knowledge about thunderstorms is restricted to precipitation or environmental proxies. Here we use a regional climate model run at convection-permitting resolution to simulate both precipitation and wind gusts over Lake Victoria for a historical 10-year period. In addition, a pseudo global warming simulation provides insight into the region?s future climate. In this simulation, ERA5?s initial and boundary conditions are perturbed with atmospheric changes between 1995?2025 and 2070?2100, projected by CMIP6?s ensemble mean. It was found that future decreases in both mean precipitation and wind gusts over Lake Victoria can be attributed to a weaker mean mesoscale circulation that reduces the trigger for over-lake nighttime convection and decreases the mean wind shear. However, an intensification of extremes is projected for both over-lake precipitation and wind gusts. The observed 7 %K?1 Clausius?Clapeyron extreme precipitation scaling is ascribed to increased water vapor content and a compensation of weaker mesoscale circulations and stronger thunderstorm dynamics. More frequent wind gust extremes result from higher wind shear conditions and more compound thunderstorms with both intense rainfall and severe wind gusts. Overall, our study emphasizes Lake Victoria?s modulating role in determining regional current and future extremes, in addition to changes expected from the Clausius?Clapeyron relation.";2021;"fishermen, thunderstorms, lake, precipitation, wind"

This is mostly due to a lack of laboratory and field-deployable methods that are capable of quantifying low-level emissions of Sb from diffuse sources. In this study, we validated two methods using a H2O2 -HNO3 liquid chemotrap and an activated coconut shell charcoal solid-phase trap, achieving an absolute limit of detection of 4.6 ng and below 2.0 ng Sb, respectively. The activated charcoal solid-phase trapping method, the most easily operated method, was then applied to contaminated shooting range soils. Four treatments were tested: 1) flooded, 2) manure amended + flooded, 3) 70 % water holding capacity, and 4) manure amendment +70 % water holding capacity, since agricultural practices and flooding events may contribute to Sb volatilization. Volatile Sb was only produced from flooded microcosms and manure amendment greatly influenced the onset and amount of volatile Sb produced. The highest amount of volatile Sb produced, up to 62.1 ng kg?1 d?1, was from the flooded manure amended soil. This suggests that anaerobic microorganisms may potentially be drivers of Sb volatilization. Our results show that polluted shooting range soils are a source of volatile Sb under flooded conditions, which may lead to an increase in the mobility of Sb. Some of these volatile Sb species are toxic and genotoxic, highlighting the role of Sb volatilization on environmental health, especially for individuals living in contaminated areas exposed to wetlands or flooded conditions (e.g., rice paddy agriculture surrounding mining areas). This work paves way for research on Sb volatilization in the environment.";2021;"microbial, sb, volatilization, methods, flooded"

The 18th century saw the formation of several short-lived meteorological networks of which the one organised by the Societas Meteorologica Palatina is arguably the most well known. This network stood out as one of the few that efficiently managed to control its members, integrating, refining, and publishing measurements taken from numerous stations around Europe and beyond. Although much has been written about the network in both history, science, and individual prominent series used for climatological studies, the actual measurements have not yet been digitised and published in extenso. This paper represents an important step towards filling this perceived gap in research. Here, we provide an inventory listing the availability of observed variables for the 37 stations that belonged to the society?s network and discuss their historical context. Most of these observations have been digitised, and a considerable fraction has been converted and formatted. In this paper, we focus on the temperature and pressure measurements, which have been corrected and homogenised. We then demonstrate their potential for climate research by analysing two cases of extreme weather. The recovered series will have wide applications and could contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind climatic variations and extremes as well as the societal reactions to adverse weather. Even the shorter series could be ingested into reanalyses and improve the quality of large-scale reconstructions.";2021;"climate, instrumental, observations, network, variables"

This will be complemented by biomonitoring to estimate PPP uptake by humans and farm animals (cow, goat, sheep and chicken), and by collection of samples from non-target species (earthworms, fish, aquatic and terrestrial macroinvertebrates, bats, and farm cats). We will use data on PPP residues in environmental and biological matrices to estimate exposures by modelling. These exposure estimates together with health and toxicity data will be used to predict the impact of PPP use on environment, plant, animal and human health.

A CP-factor tool was developed adapted to Swiss agronomic and environmental conditions, which allows to calculate CP-factors easily for various crop rotations and management practices. The calculated CP-factor values can be linked to any field block in the potential soil erosion risk map to determine the actual soil erosion risk for the field block.

The objective of this study was to identify the effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations on nutrient concentrations of grassland biomass that have been grown for 16 years (1998?2013). The grassland biomass grown at the extensively managed Giessen FACE experiment, fumigated with ambient and elevated CO2 (aCO2; eCO2; +20%) was harvested twice annually. Concentrations of C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu and Zn were determined separately for grasses, forbs and legumes. Under eCO2, the concentration of N was reduced in grasses, Ca was reduced in grasses and forbs, P was reduced in grasses but increased in legumes, Mg concentration was reduced in grasses, forbs and legumes and K was reduced in grasses but increased in forbs. The nutrient yield (in g nutrient yield of an element per m-2) of most elements indicated negative yield responses at a zero biomass response to eCO2 for grasses. K and Zn nutrient yields responded positively to eCO2 in forbs and Mn and Fe responded positively in forbs and legumes. The results suggest that under eCO2 the nutrient concentrations were not diluted by the CO2 fertilization effect. Rather, altered plant nutrient acquisitions via changed physiological mechanisms prevail for increased C assimilation under eCO2. Furthermore, other factors such as water or nutrient availability affected plant nutrient concentrations under eCO2.";2021;"co2, nutrients, biomass, concentrations, grassland"

If and how such compartmentalized functions interact to determine plant?environment interactions is not well understood. Here, we investigated how the dual role of maize benzoxazinoids as leaf defenses and root siderophores shapes the interaction between maize and a major global insect pest, the fall armyworm. We find that benzoxazinoids suppress fall armyworm growth when plants are grown in soils with very low available iron but enhance growth in soils with higher available iron. Manipulation experiments confirm that benzoxazinoids suppress herbivore growth under iron-deficient conditions and in the presence of chelated iron but enhance herbivore growth in the presence of free iron in the growth medium. This reversal of the protective effect of benzoxazinoids is not associated with major changes in plant primary metabolism. Plant defense activation is modulated by the interplay between soil iron and benzoxazinoids but does not explain fall armyworm performance. Instead, increased iron supply to the fall armyworm by benzoxazinoids in the presence of free iron enhances larval performance. This work identifies soil chemistry as a decisive factor for the impact of plant secondary metabolites on herbivore growth. It also demonstrates how the multifunctionality of plant secondary metabolites drives interactions between abiotic and biotic factors, with potential consequences for plant resistance in variable environments.";2021;"metabolites, interaction, iron, herbivore, environment"

"646";"The Politics of Decentralization: Competition in Land Administration and Management in Ghana";"James Adam Natia and Timothy Adams and Jean-David Gerber";"Decentralization policy forms part of a broader global ideology and effort of the international donor community in favor of subsidiarity and local participation, and represents a paradigm shift from top-down command-and-control systems. Since 2003, the formalization of property rights through titling became an integral component of decentralized land administration efforts in Ghana. The creation of new forms of local government structures and the related changes in the distribution of responsibilities between different levels of government have an impact on natural resource management, the allocation of rights, and the unequal distribution of powers. This paper aims to understand how decentralization reforms modify the balance of power between public administration, customary authorities, and resource end-users in Ghana. Decentralization?s impact is analyzed based on two case studies. Relying on purposive and snowball sampling techniques, and mixed methods, we conducted 8 key informant interviews with local government bureaucrats in land administration, 16 semi-structured interviews with allodial landholders, 20 biographic interviews and 8 focus group discussions with small-scale farmers. The interviews analyzed the institutions and the roles of actors in land administration. Our case studies show that decentralization has the tendency to increase local competition in land administration where there are no clear distribution of power and obligation to local actors. Local competition and elitism in land administration impact the ability of small-scale farmers to regularize or formalize land rights. Thus, the paper concludes that local competition and the elitism within the land administration domain in Ghana could be the main obstacles towards decentralization reforms.";2021;"decentralization, land, power, competition, ghana"

Ramos and Tim Woollings";"The physical understanding and timely prediction of extreme weather events are of enormous importance to society regarding associated impacts. In this article, we highlight several types of weather extremes occurring in Europe in connection with a particular atmospheric flow pattern, known as atmospheric blocking. This flow pattern effectively blocks the prevailing westerly large-scale atmospheric flow, resulting in changing flow anomalies in the vicinity of the blocking system and persistent conditions in the immediate region of its occurrence. Blockings are long-lasting, quasi-stationary, self-sustaining systems that occur frequently over certain regions. Their presence and characteristics have an impact on the predictability of weather extremes and can thus be used as potential indicators. The phasing between the surface and the upper-level blocking anomalies is of major importance for the development of the extreme event. In summer, heat waves and droughts form below the blocking anticyclone primarily via large-scale subsidence that leads to cloud-free skies and thus, persistent longwave radiative warming of the ground. In winter, cold waves that occur during atmospheric blocking are normally observed downstream or south of these systems. Here, horizontal advection of cold air masses from higher latitudes plays a decisive role. Extreme snowfall can also occur with the lower temperatures, indicating a shift of the storm track due to the blocking system. Such a shift is also crucial in the connection of blocking with wind and precipitation anomalies in general. Due to this multifaceted linkages, compound events are often observed in conjunction with blocking conditions.";2021;"extreme, weather, patterns, europe, blocking"

This paper explores how powerholders influence land use decision-making and what their engagement implies for territorial control. We analyse three cases of land use changes in Myanmar?s south between 1990 and 2015, where the Myanmar state and an ethnic minority organization fought over territorial control. We gathered qualitative data with a mix of methods and visualised actor networks and institutions. Our analysis reveals that the state managed to increasingly control decisionmaking over local land use from a distance by employing actor alliances and institutions such as laws and incentives, whereas the ethnic organization lost influence. We conclude that engaging in land use decisionmaking plays a crucial role in influencing the outcomes of a civil war and that it represents a form of war- and state-making.";2021;"powerholders, land use, territorial control, Myanmar, civil war"
"650";"Why municipalities grow: The influence of fiscal incentives on municipal land policies in Germany and the Netherlands";"Vera G{\"o";"It is generally assumed that municipalities attract residents and businesses as a result of intermunicipal competition for tax revenues. This growth-oriented behaviour poses a serious problem considering internationally acknowledged goals to limit land take. Nonetheless, research on how fiscal incentives affect municipal land policies is scarce. Adapting a neoinstitutionalist approach, we compare the two contrasting fiscal systems of Germany and the Netherlands. While clear incentives can be deducted from the different sources of municipal income, complex balancing measurements and consequential infrastructure investments make it difficult to predict a project?s profitability. According to the perspective of planning practitioners in municipalities around the growth centres of Utrecht and Berlin interviewed for this study, local pressures force them to keep allocating new building sites. In order to create effective policies to limit land take, it is important to understand not only the influence of fiscal incentives but also of place-specific pressures on municipal land policies.";2021;"municipalities, competition, tax revenues, land policies, fiscal incentives"

"659";"Cost-effective assessment of urban heat island intensities and its potential for action-oriented climate change education: An educational reconstruction";"Moritz Raffael Gubler";"Education is seen as a key leverage point to tackle the unprecedented challenges arising from anthropogenic climate change. Situated within the broader context of education for sustainable development, action-oriented climate change education aims at empowering particularly young people to proactively initiate and implement individual and collective responses addressing the climate crisis. Thus, there exists a need to identify and understand education-related preconditions and strategies that contribute to the development of action competencies among students. Emphasizing local, present, and personally relevant manifestations of climate change is popularly proposed as an effective communication and education strategy to foster motivations for climate change engagement. Despite extensive research on individuals? cognitive, affective, and behaviour-related responses to reductions of the so-called psychological distance of climate change in social, psychological, and communication sciences, the proposition lacks empirical investigation in educational contexts and among the important cohort of young people. The present thesis aims at addressing this blind spot by exploring the potentials and limitations of proximizing climate change as an action-oriented education strategy from an interdisciplinary and multimethodological perspective. Following the conceptual framework of the model of educational reconstruction, it thereby addresses multiple discipline-specific and cross-disciplinary research gaps and aims related to the fields of urban climatology, environmental and social psychology, as well as climate change education. Taking the perspective of urban climatology, the first goal is to assess summertime urban heat island intensities in Bern, Switzerland at high resolutions using cost-effective measurement devices and geostatistical modelling. The results approve the applicability of a network consisting of 79 low-cost measurement devices for detailed assessments of intra-urban air temperature variability, although intercomparisons with automated weather stations show that daytime observations require careful interpretation due to potential radiation biases. Based on these data, land use regression modelling is shown to be a reliable approach for high-resolution urban heat island mapping during heatwaves using easily accessible geospatial data. Besides allowing for the planning and implementation of adaptation strategies to reduce the risks of intensifying urban heat stress, the fine-scaled analysis of intra-urban air temperature variability provides the science content-related basis for the development of a learning opportunity focussing on proximate impacts of climate change. The second goal consists of examining how young people perceive, judge, and respond to climate change through the lens of environmental and social psychology. On the one hand, results of a questionnaire study among secondary school students in the Canton of Bern (N = 587) suggest that adolescents perceive climate to be a certain and present risk that affects other places and people rather than themselves. Further, regression analysis reveals a significant inverse relationship between perceived psychological distance of and concern about climate change. On the other hand, a survey among young people (N = 4057) in the German-speaking part of Switzerland reveals that participation in the climate strike movement is most strongly linked to social identification with the strikers. Based on the finding that beliefs about the effectiveness of the movement, level of education, and worries about climate change are also associated with participating in the youth strikes, these results suggest that social identity-related processes seem at least as important as risk perceptions for collective climate action among young people. Taken as a whole, these insights uncover important socio-psychological determinants of young people?s engagement with climate change and subsequently allow for a student-centred educational reconstruction of psychologically close manifestations of climate change. The third and ultimate aim is to investigate the suggestion of education about proximate risks of climate change resulting in higher motivations of students for climate change engagement based on an educational intervention manipulating the psychological distance of climate change in the content-related context of urban heat stress and human health (Bern vs. Singapore). The resulting effects of proximized climate change education on cognitive (perceived severity of climate change risks), emotional (worry about climate change), and behaviour-related responses (behavioural intentions for climate action) of adolescents are compared across a psychologically close setting (N = 162), a psychologically distant setting (N = 169), and a neutral control group (N = 217). Although the results show a significant effect of the close treatment resulting in an increase of all outcome variables, its interaction with gender reveals a reactance effect among male participants, which is reflected in a decrease in level of worries and behavioural intentions. In sum, the findings suggest that the imperative of proximized climate change education leading to higher motivations to act on the issue is not straightforward as often assumed due to interactions with individual characteristics. In conclusion, this thesis makes not only an important contribution to the understanding and empirically supported development of action-oriented climate change education strategies, but also to a deeper comprehension of how young people view, conceptualize, feel about, and act on the perhaps greatest challenge of this century. Complemented by profound insights into cost-effective approaches to assess the exposure of urban populations to heat-related risks, this thesis provides an example of how multiple research perspectives may contribute to the whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts.";2021;"education, climate, young, urban, psychology"
"660";"Modelling the spatial pattern of heatwaves in the city of Bern using a land use regression approach";"Moritz Alexander Burger and Moritz Raffael Gubler and Andreas Heinimann and Stefan Br{\"o";"Heatwaves have been the deadliest weather extreme events in Europe in the last decades. People living in cities are especially prone to such events due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect which increases the heat stress in urban surroundings especially during calm, steady, and radiation intensive synoptic situations. Since official measurement stations in cities are scarce, studies on spatial patterns of UHIs often rely on satellite data, hobby meteorologists' data, or on model outputs. Additionally, analyses of spatial UHI patterns using point-based measurements need adequate and cost-effective methods for spatial interpolation. In this study, air temperature data retrieved by 60 low cost measurement devices (LCD) are used to model the spatial pattern of the UHI with a land use regression (LUR) approach in Bern, Switzerland. For this purpose, 14 spatial variables with different buffer radii were calculated to evaluate their effect on the UHI and to interpolate the air temperature data. As a result, three models covering three different heatwaves at nighttime were developed. Given good model performance throughout the different scenarios, the here presented study demonstrates the successful interpolation of low cost temperature data by LUR modelling based on publicly accessible spatial information within a city.";2021;"heatwaves, cities, urban, satellite, temperature"

We used a backward Lagrangian stochastic model combined with concentration measurements by open-path tunable diode laser spectrometers placed up- and downwind of a naturally ventilated housing with 40 dairy cows to determine the CH4 emissions.

"663";"Intercomparison and combination of low-cost urban air temperature measurement approaches [Dataset]";"Moritz Raffael Gubler and Fred Meier and Lukas Simon Meyer and Stefan Br{\"o";"Measurements of urban air temperatures (Tair) are vital to successful adaptation and mitigation policies to increasing urban heat stress. However, in-situ measurements in cities are often scarce and costly, and therefore low-cost approaches are increasingly used to study urban Tair. This allows for inexpensive, yet still highly spatially and temporally resolved observations of urban Tair. Despite their merits, a common issue of such low-cost approaches is lacking data quality and potential measurement errors. Here, we compare three low-cost measurement approaches regarding their ability to capture intra-urban variability of Tair over a period of 24 hours in Bern, Switzerland: a) A network of 79 low-cost measurement devices (LCD), b) bicycle mounted mobile measurements (BCY), and c) 581 Netatmo citizen weather stations (CWS). As the BCY sensor is actively ventilated, it is used as the reference for intercomparisons with LCD and CWS. Compared to the BCY, the median difference of Tair for LCD is found to be slightly negative over the entire study period (-0.07 K) as well as during night-time (-0.09 K), and positive during daytime (0.07 K). The CWS show a positive median difference of 0.66 K over the entire study period, 0.98 K during night-time, and a negative difference of -0.18 K during daytime. BCY and LCD both show a distinct pattern of nocturnal intra-urban Tair variability, which is less pronounced in the CWS measurements. Furthermore, the intercomparison of the three approaches across local climate zones reveals that CWS do not well represent forested areas. Whilst the bias sources of the individual approaches require in-depth investigation in future studies (e.g., external heat sources and measurement height for BCY, daytime short-wave radiation errors for LCD, and nocturnal thermal heating by nearby buildings for CWS), we conclude that the combination of the three measurement approaches provides a high observation density in urban environments at low costs.";2021;"urban, temperature, lowcost, variability, measurement"

In Senegal, agroecological advocacy coalitions, made up of farmers? organizations, scientists, NGOs, and IOs, are using agroecology as an umbrella concept for proposing policy changes at multiple scales. We describe the history of the agroecological movement in Senegal in the context of the constitution of a national advocacy coalition. We then examine the ?repertoires of collective action? mobilized by the coalition. Four repertoires are identified: technical support and knowledge co-production, territorial governance, alternative food networks, and national policy dialogue. Our analysis highlights the potential that these multi-level approaches have to sustainably transform the current food systems in sub-Saharan Africa. However, our research also reveals the limited agency of farmer organizations and the limitations of a movement that is strongly dependent on NGOs and international donors, leading to a ?projectorate? situation in which contradictory policy actions can overlap. We further argue that, although the central government has formally welcomed some of the principles of agroecology into their policy discourse, financial and political interests in pursuing a Green Revolution and co-opting agroecology are pending. This leads to a lack of political and financial autonomy for grassroots farmers? organizations, limiting the development of counter-hegemonic agroecology. We discuss the conditions under which territorial approaches, and the three other repertoires of collective action, can have significant potential to transform Sub-Saharan Africa in the coming years.";2021;"agroecology, advocacy, policy, transformation, grassroots"

Insights from a Case Study in New York City";"Nora Helen Komposch and Nicholas Pohl and Yvonne Ria{~n";"Many migrant women in New York City face structural discrimination and administrative hurdles that complicate their access to safe and well-paid labor. Worker cooperatives have been shown to reduce the precarity and economic exclusion of marginalized groups. However, although much is known about worker cooperatives? economic potential for improving workers? lives, other social effects remain far less well explored. The present research contributes to exploring this gap by examining how joining a worker cooperative empowers migrant women in their everyday lives. We apply the concept of self-empowerment to several spheres of the everyday lives of migrant women. At an empirical level, the study focuses on migrant women who are members of nine cleaning- or care-worker cooperatives in New York City. The data were gathered using a participatory research approach and consist of interviews, participant observations, and a quantitative survey. The findings are that worker cooperatives have empowering effects on migrant women beyond the sphere of paid work. Although the additional unpaid workload as co-owners of cooperatives represents an extra burden for many migrant women, they now have better wages, more flexibility, and safer workplaces. Furthermore, they acquire a range of leadership skills, enlarge their social network beyond their ethnic communities, and earn increased esteem as co-owners of businesses. Through worker-ownership, migrant women thus increase their economic, cultural, social, and symbolic capital, which enables them to exercise more agency not only in their paid work but also in their families and leisure time.";2021;"migrant, worker cooperatives, empowerment, new york city, women"
"671";"Integration of ridesharing with public transport in rural Switzerland: Practice and outcomes";"Vu Thi Thao and Sebastian Stephan Imhof and Widar von Arx";"Using advanced technologies, ridesharing has transformed transportation in many cities. The effective integration of ridesharing into public transport systems can provide an opportunity for public transport authorities to solve the common problem of rural transport, namely poor accessibility due to the dispersal of the population. However, literature on the integration of ridesharing with public transport is rather scant. At the same time, while ridesharing has been extended to rural communities, so far this has attracted little research. To fill in these gaps, this paper seeks to explore the practice and outcomes of integrating ridesharing with public transport. The analysis is based on a case study of a community-based ridesharing scheme in four rural municipalities in central Switzerland. Using a mixed methods approach, the key findings show the public transport authority designing the integration with a goal to complementing public transport with ridesharing. To achieve this goal, three crucial approaches were adopted: the provision of information on the ridesharing scheme, the integration of ridesharing notice boards into the local bus stop and regional railway station networks; and the price strategies as a means to signify a contractual relationship between rider and driver and to reduce a potential competition. Even though ridesharing use is still only moderate, the authorities are satisfied with the outcome and do not consider cost-effectiveness to be important.";2021;"technologies, integration, transportation, rural, outcomes"

Simpson and Cesar Velasquez";"How Indigenous peoples and European settlers transformed terrestrial ecosystems in the Americas is well evidenced in the literature, but far less is known about how aquatic ecosystems changed. This study examined diatom records from sediment cores from paleoclimate studies in mountain lakes of Guatemala, Panama, and Colombia, in order to clarify the long-term human influences on the ecology of these lakes. We focused on two aspects of beta diversity in identified diatom zones: species turnover and variation in relative abundances of species. All records displayed a single diatom zone or cluster of zones with assemblages that had no close analogues in the past. The ages of these distinctive assemblages varied from post-European to 5000 cal yr BP. Most novel assemblages comprised moderately motile, non-planktonic, single-celled diatoms, associated with disturbed, productive environments. Archaeological data and pollen records pointed to the onset of intensification of human activities as the main driver behind the changes in diatoms. Maximum depth exerted control on how diatom communities responded to anthropogenic stressors. In shallower lakes, diatom assemblages transitioned gradually over time into their current novel composition. In deeper lakes, assemblages displayed slight fluctuations before shifting to their current condition. Differences between the two lake groups likely resulted from a more complete water-column mixing and higher rates of nutrient cycling in the shallow lakes, which led to a more rapid response of the diatoms to environmental changes. The shift to novel recent diatom assemblages suggests that these lakes now display ecosystem characteristics with no past analogues, and that they have lost their capacity to resist change or recover from stressors, jeopardizing the future of mountain water resources.

Political debates are often organised normatively: the debate on the sustainable development goals presents migration foremost as a development issue resulting from global inequalities. The problems faced by particular migrants, and what a more sustainable approach to migration would look like are, therefore, often lost in political debates. We aim to address those gaps: the article conceptualizes, based on established academic debates, how sustainability in migration can be addressed systematically, which aspects are important for a more sustainable migration process and which trade-offs and injustices exist from several perspectives. We create a conceptual framework of sustainability in migration processes, building on the concepts of inter- and intragenerational justice, commonly accepted as the core of the sustainability concept. We apply this conceptual framework to empirical findings on labour migration and multilocality in Kyrgyzstan. The case enables consideration of the nested system effects of scale and translocality. This research is novel because it bridges the divided literature on migration, justice and sustainability, integrates theoretical and empirical insights and provokes a debate on which kind of migration we want to achieve.";2021;"migration, mobility, sustainability, justice, development"

We investigate the effects of protected areas and various land tenure regimes on deforestation and possible spillover effects in Bolivia, a global tropical deforestation hotspot. We use a spatial Durbin model to assess and compare the direct and indirect effects of protected areas and different land tenure types on forest loss in Bolivia from 2010 to 2017. We find that protected areas have a strong direct effect on reducing deforestation. Protected areas ? which in Bolivia are all based on co-management schemes - also protect forests in adjacent areas, showing a protective spillover effect. Indigenous lands however only have weak direct forest protection effects. Non-indigenous collective lands and small private lands, which are associated to Andean settlers, and non-titled lands show a strong direct effect on deforestation. At the same time these lands also encourage deforestation in adjacent areas, indicating the existence of spillovers. Interestingly, areas with high poverty rate tend to be less impacted by deforestation whatever tenure type. Our findings suggest that long-lasting co-management instruments rather than land tenure types are key to conserve tropical forests.";2021;"conversion, threat, biodiversity, protected areas, deforestation"

A disequilibrium between glaciers and climate affects meltwater release to Central Asian rivers, challenging the region's water availability. Previous research has neglected temporal variability. We present glacier mass balance estimates based on transient snowline and geodetic surveys with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution from 1999/00 to 2017/18. Our results reveal spatiotemporal heterogeneity characterized by two mass balance clusters: (a) positive, low variability, and (b) negative, high variability.

The atmospheric conditions prior to and during multi-day hail clusters are described and contrasted to the conditions prior to and during isolated hail days. The analysis focuses on hail days that occurred between April and September 2002?2019 within 140-km of the Swiss radar network. Hail days north and south of the Alps are defined using a minimum area threshold of a radar-based hail product. Multi-day clusters are defined as 5-day windows containing 4 or 5 hail days and isolated hail days as 5-day windows containing a single hail day. The reanalysis ERA-5 is used to study the large-scale flow in combination with objectively identified cold fronts, atmospheric blocking events, and a weather type classification. Both north and south of the Alps, isolated hail days have frequency maxima in May and August-September whereas clustered hail days occur mostly in July and August. Composites of atmospheric variables indicate a more stationary and meridionally amplified atmospheric flow both north and south of the Alps during multi-day hail clusters. On clustered hail days north of the Alps, blocks are more frequent over the North Sea, and surface fronts are located farther from Switzerland than on isolated hail days. Clustered hail days north of the Alps are also characterized by significantly higher convective available potential energy (CAPE) values, warmer daily maximum surface temperatures, and higher atmospheric moisture content than isolated hail days. Hence, both stationary flow conditions and anomalous amounts of moisture are necessary for multi-day hail clusters on the north side. In contrast, differences in CAPE on the south side between clustered hail days and isolated hail days are small. The mean sea level pressure south of the Alps is significantly deeper, the maximum temperature is colder, and local moisture is significantly lower on isolated hail days. Both north and south of the Alps, the upper-level atmospheric flow over the eastern Atlantic is meridionally more amplified three days prior to clustered hail days than prior to isolated days. Moreover, Moreover blocking occurs prior to more than 10-% of clustered hail days over Scandinavia, but no blocks occur prior to isolated hail days. Half of the clustered hail days south of the Alps are also clustered north of the Alps. On hail days clustering only south of the Alps, fronts are more frequently located on the Alpine ridge, and local low- level winds are stronger. The temporal clustering of hail days is coupled to specific synoptic- and local- scale flow conditions, this information may be exploited for short to medium-range forecasts of hail in Switzerland.";2021;"hail, atmospheric, clusters, conditions, alps"

A widespread parent material for soils";"Jaroslaw Waroszewski and Anna Pietranik and Tobias Sprafke and Cezary Kaba{l";"Thin loess deposits are widespread soil parent materials and important archives for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The origin of loess in SW Poland is attributed to the Great Odra Valley (GOV), following the general concept that large rivers play a major role in regional silt supply. Yet, the precise provenance (glacier sources and/or local rocks) of silts, possibly deflated from dry GOV braided riverbeds, is not clear. Our study of thin and thick loess mantles in SW Poland for the first time indicates the provenance of thin loess based on mineralogical (MLA-SEM) and isotopic analyses (143Nd/144Nd, 87Sr/86Sr). Luminescence ages of five localities point to thin loess mantle formation during and shortly (23.0 to 17.7 ka yr) after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Our isotopic data indicate that thin loess deposits in SW Poland are the mixtures of two main components ? local Sudetic and Scandinavian, the latter delivered by the Fennoscandian ice sheet (FIS). Also, detailed analyses of heavy minerals show that a single mineral (e.g., hornblende) may come from both Sudetic and Scandinavian sources. This research highlights the role of the (Pleistocene) GOV in collecting and homogenizing materials, while supplying the region with fine particles to be deflated by paleowinds from open surfaces. Anomalies in mineralogy and isotopic composition are connected with influence of Sudetic mountain rivers and locally blowing silt material by katabatic winds. Regional grain size differentiation of thin loess mantles explains transport distance and altitude.";2021;"loess, provenance, mineralogical, isotopic, paleoenvironmental"

How-ever, national-level analysis that is crucial for national policy on sustainable agricultural investments and land use is still lacking. This paper conducts an archetype analysis of a unique dataset on land concessions in Lao PDR to provide a national-scale assessment of the impacts of land acquisitions on human well-being in 294 affected villages. The results show that land acquisitions influence human well-being through 18 distinct pathways. These pathways describe how some land acquisitions enhance or maintain well-being, while others elicit adverse im-pacts or trade-offs between well-being dimensions, particularly food security, income, and livelihood resilience. They further reveal five  archetypical processes that  mediate the  effects of  land  acquisitions on  well-being through: (i) shifting access to land and natural resources; (ii) commercialization of agriculture; (iii) availability of development opportunities; (iv) environmental impacts; and (v) employment opportunities within and outside land acquisitions. These processes affect well-being by shaping livelihood portfolios and dependence on natural resources. The majority of land acquisitions trigger trade-offs or adverse impacts on well-being. The small number of villages where well-being increased despite the presence of land acquisitions were mainly shaped by narrow and  rigid preconditions. The  archetypical processes and  the  explanatory factors suggest that  it  is imperative to protect smallholders? land-use rights and to avoid large-scale deals, as their adverse impacts outweigh opportunities and are more severe than the impacts of small-scale acquisitions. Employment opportunities may provide additional cash income but should not be exclusively relied upon.";2021;"land acquisitions, human well-being, national-level analysis, livelihood, impacts"

Here we analyse sub-seasonal clustering in Switzerland, first characterizing the tendency of precipitation extremes to cluster in time for each season separately, and second, linking the occurrence of persistent flood events to sub-seasonal clusters of precipitation extremes. We find a distinct spatio-temporal pattern in temporal clustering behavior of precipitation extremes, with temporal clustering occurring on the northern side of the Alps in winter, and on their southern side in fall. In winter, the magnitude of precipitation extremes is generally lower, and much of the precipitation falls as snow, therefore temporal clusters contribute little to the occurrence of persistent flood events. In fall, however, temporal clusters associated with large precipitation accumulations over the southern Alps are found to be almost systematically followed by floods. In addition, discharge magnitudes decrease more slowly after clustered extremes.";2021;"extreme, precipitation, clustering, floods, spatio-temporal"

"689";"Loess landscapes of Europe ? Mapping, geomorphology, and zonal differentiation";"F. Lehmkuhl and J.J. Nett and S. P{\"o";"Paleoenvironmental reconstructions on a (supra-)regional scale have gained attention in Quaternary sciences during the last decades. In terrestrial realms, loess deposits and especially intercalations of loess and buried soils, so called loess-paleosol sequences (LPS) are important archives to unravel the terrestrial response to e.g. climatic fluctuations and reconstruct paleoenvironments during the Pleistocene. The analysis of LPS requires the knowledge of several key factors, such as the distribution of the aeolian sediments, their location relative to (potential) source areas, the climate conditions that led to their emplacement and the topography of the sink area. These factors strongly influence the sedimentological and paleoenvironmental characteristics of LPS and show broad variations throughout Europe, leading to a distinct distribution pattern throughout the continent.  We present a new map of the distribution of aeolian sediments (mainly loess) and major potential source areas for Europe. The map was compiled combining geodata of different mapping approaches. Most of the used geodata stems from accurate national maps of 27 different countries. Problematic aspects such as different nomenclatures across administrative borders were carefully investigated and revised. The result is a seamless map, which comprises pedological, geological, and geomorphological data and can be used for paleoenvironmental and archeological studies and other applications.  We use the resulting map and data from key geomorphological cross-sections to discuss the various influences of geomorphology and paleoenvironment on the deposition and preservation of Late Pleistocene loess throughout Europe. We divided the loess areas into 6 main loess domains and 17 subdomains to understand and explain the factors controlling their distribution and characteristics. For the subdivision we used the following criteria: (1) influence of silt production areas, (2) affiliation to subcatchments, as rivers are very important regional silt transport agents, (3) occurrence of past periglacial activity with characteristic overprinting of the deposits. Additionally, the sediment distribution is combined with elevation data, to investigate the loess distribution statistically as well as visually.  Throughout Europe, the variations, and differences of the loess domains are the results of a complex interplay of changing paleoenvironmental conditions and related geomorphologic processes, controlling dust sources, transport, accumulation, preservation, pedogenesis, alongside erosional and reworking events. Climatic, paleoclimatic, and pedoclimatic gradients are on the continental scale an additional important factor, since there are e.g. latitudinal differences of permafrost and periglacial processes, an increase in continentality from west to east and in aridity from northwest to southeast and south, strongly affecting regional sedimentary and geomorphic dynamics.  We propose three main depositional regimes for loess formation in Europe: (1.) periglacial and tundra loess formation with periglacial processes and permafrost in the high latitude and mountainous regions; (2.) steppe and desert margin loess formation in the (semi-)arid regions; and (3.) loess and soil formation in temperate and subtropical regions. Loess deposits of (1.) and (2.) show coarser, sandier particle distributions towards the glacial and desert regions. In the humid areas (3.) forest vegetation limited dust production and accumulation, therefore, there is an increase in finer grain sizes due to an increase in weathering.";2021;"paleoenvironmental, aeolian, loess, europe, geomorphology"

We assess the co-occurrence of precipitation days and compare the full precipitation distributions. The co-occurrence is quantified by the hit rate. An extended generalized Pareto distribution (EGPD) is fitted to the positive precipitation distribution at every grid point and confidence intervals of quantiles compared. The Kullback?Leibler divergence is used to quantify the distance between the entire EGPDs obtained from ERA-5 and the observations. For days exceeding the local 90th percentile, the mean hit rate is 65% between ERA-5 and EOBS (over Europe) and 60% between ERA-5 and CMORPH (globally). Generally, we find a decrease of the co-occurrence with increasing precipitation intensity. The agreement between ERA-5 and EOBS is weaker over the southern Mediterranean region and Iceland compared to the rest of Europe. Differences between ERA-5 and CMORPH are smallest over the oceans. Differences are largest over NW America, Central Asia, and land areas between 15?S and 15?N. The confidence intervals on quantiles are overlapping between ERA-5 and the observational data sets for more than 80% of the grid points on average. The intensity comparisons indicate an excellent agreement between ERA-5 and EOBS over Germany, Ireland, Sweden, and Finland, and a disagreement over areas where EOBS uses sparse input stations.

Climate change and human impact are expected to increasingly deteriorate aquatic ecosystems. The study of processes and drivers of such changes in the past provides a great asset for prevention and remediation in the future. We used a multi-proxy approach combining high-resolution bulk pigment data measured by Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI), with lower resolution specific chlorophylls and carotenoids measured by HPLC to examine Holocene trophic state changes and anoxia evolution in meromictic Lake Jaczno, NE Poland. A redundancy analysis RDA including pollen-inferred vegetation cover, temperature and human impacts provides insight into specific conditions and drivers of changing trophic and redox states in the lake. Anoxic and sulfidic conditions established in Lake Jaczno after initial basin infilling 9500 years ago. Until 6700 cal BP, lake trophy was relatively low, water turbidity was high, and green sulfur bacteria (GSB) were abundant within the phototrophic community, suggesting a deep oxic?anoxic boundary and weak stratification. The period between 6700?500 cal BP is characterized by constantly increasing lake production and a gradual shift from GSB to purple sulfur bacteria (PSB), suggesting a shallower oxic?anoxic boundary and pronounced stratification. Yet, the presence of spheroidene and speroidenone in the sediments indicates intermittent anoxia. After 500 cal BP, increasing human impact, deforestation and intensive agriculture promoted lake eutrophication, with a shift to PSB dominance and establishment of permanent anoxia and meromixis. Our study unambiguously documents the legacy of human impact on processes determining eutrophication and anoxia.";2021;"hypoxia, lake, vegetation, trophic, anoxia"

Depending on extensive measurement networks, high-resolution air temperature measurements in urban environments are challenging due to high instrumentation and maintenance costs. Here, we present a low-cost measurement device (LCD) consisting of a temperature logger and a custom-made, naturally ventilated radiation shield. Besides intercomparisons with automated weather stations (AWS) at three reference sites during record-dry summer 2018, we tested the potential of the devices using a network of 79 LCDs to assess the intra-urban variability of urban heat island (UHI) patterns in the city of Bern, Switzerland. We found positive mean measurement biases between LCDs and AWS of 0.61 to 0.93 K (RMSE: 0.78 to 1.17 K) during daytime, of which up to 82.8% of the variance could be explained statistically by solar irradiance (radiative heating) and wind speed (insufficient ventilation). During night, average measurement biases were markedly lower and eventually negative with ?0.12 to 0.23 K (RMSE: 0.19 to 0.34 K). Our results highlight the importance of sensor intercomparisons being conducted at multiple locations with differing urban land-cover, structure, and metabolism given that biases varied considerably between the reference sites. Data retrieved by the city-wide measurement network showed that the LCD approach is well suited for the analysis of spatiotemporal UHI patterns during night and adds considerable value compared to the few existing AWS in detecting fine-scale air temperature variability. In conclusion, the current LCD measurement approach represents a valuable option for cost-effective analyses of urban air temperature variability across multiple scales, which may be of particular value for the development, appliance, and monitoring of adaptation strategies to climate change in cities with restricted financial resources.";2021;"urban, temperature, measurement, variability, low-cost"

Here, we report on relict large sorted stone stripes (up to 1000 m long, 15 m wide, and 2 m deep) on the ca. 4000 m high central Sanetti Plateau of the tropical Bale Mountains in the southern Ethiopian Highlands. These geomorphic features are enigmatic since forms of patterned ground exceeding several metres are commonly associated with distinct seasonal ground temperatures, oscillating around 0 ? C. To systematically investigate present frost phenomena and relict periglacial landforms in the Bale Mountains, we conducted extensive geomorphological mapping. The sorted stone stripes were studied in more detail by applying aerial photogrammetry, ground-penetrating radar measurements, and 36 Cl surface exposure dating. In addition, we installed ground temperature data loggers between 3877 and 4377 m to analyse present frost occurrence and seasonal ground temperature variations. Superficial nocturnal ground frost was measured at 35?90 d per year, but the ground beneath the upper few centimetres remains unfrozen the entire year. Seasonal frost occurrence would require a mean annual ground temperature depression of about 11 ? C, corresponding to an air temperature decrease of about 6?8 ? C (relative to today) as inferred from a simple statistical ground temperature model experiment. Our results suggest the formation of the large sorted stone stripes under past periglacial conditions related to lateral and vertical frost sorting in the course of cyclic freezing and thawing of the ground. It is likely that the stone stripes formed either in proximity to a former ice cap on the Sanetti Plateau over the last glacial period due to seasonal frost heave and sorting or they developed over multiple cold phases during the Pleistocene. Although certain aspects of the genesis of the large sorted stone stripes remain unresolved, the presence of these geomorphic features provides independent evidence besides glacial landforms for unprecedented palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental changes in the tropical Bale Mountains during the (Late) Pleistocene.";2021;"sorted, stone, stripes, periglacial, tropics"

However, how specific classes of root exudate compounds impact the assembly of root-associated microbiotas is not well understood, especially not under realistic field conditions. Maize roots secrete benzoxazinoids (BXs), a class of indole-derived defense compounds, and thereby impact the assembly of their microbiota. Here, we investigated the broader impacts of BX exudation on root and rhizosphere microbiotas of adult maize plants grown under natural conditions at different field locations in Europe and the USA. We examined the microbiotas of BX- producing and multiple BX-defective lines in two genetic backgrounds across three soils with different properties. Results: Our analysis showed that BX secretion affected the community composition of the rhizosphere and root microbiota, with the most pronounced effects observed for root fungi. The impact of BX exudation was at least as strong as the genetic background, suggesting that BX exudation is a key trait by which maize structures its associated microbiota. BX-producing plants were not consistently enriching microbial lineages across the three field experiments. However, BX exudation consistently depleted Flavobacteriaceae and Comamonadaceae and enriched various potential plant pathogenic fungi in the roots across the different environments. Conclusions: These findings reveal that BXs have a selective impact on root and rhizosphere microbiota composition across different conditions. Taken together, this study identifies the BX pathway as an interesting breeding target to manipulate plant-microbiome interactions.";2021;"impact, benzoxazinoids, microbiota, maize, soil"

Unfortunately, Istanbul is also at the crossroads of major active fault lines. This paper analyzes earthquake risk mitigation planning for the megacity since the last big seismic catastrophe of the Marmara Earthquakes in 1999 that hit the region, including Istanbul. We use the concept of riskscape to explore the political and technocratic construction of seismic risk and how this implies different experiences of risk to investment portfolios, the state, and the ordinary people living in the city. Our empirical analyses focus on the ?Istanbul Seismic Risk Mitigation and Emergency Preparedness Project? (ISMEP), launched as a World Bank project in 2005 and still ongoing as of 2020. We argue that the ISMEP project epitomizes the ?strange case? of earthquake risk mitigation in Istanbul due to its organizational complexity, financial expansion over its lifetime, and progression as a megaproject sponsored by international development funding despite its contraction in institutional targets. Our findings suggest that this centralized and non- transparent earthquake risk mitigation approach in Istanbul creates a fragmented riskscape for the megacity.

It can cause large precipitation accumulations and lead to floods. We present a novel, count-based procedure to identify episodes of sub-seasonal clustering of extreme precipitation. We introduce two metrics to characterise the frequency of sub-seasonal clustering episodes and their relevance for large precipitation accumulations. The procedure does not require the investigated variable (here precipitation) to satisfy any specific statistical properties. Applying this procedure to daily precipitation from the ERA5 reanalysis data set, we identify regions where sub-seasonal clustering occurs frequently and contributes substantially to large precipitation accumulations. The regions are the east and northeast of the Asian continent (north of Yellow Sea, in the Chinese provinces of Hebei, Jilin and Liaoning; North and South Korea; Siberia and east of Mongolia), central Canada and south of California, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula, and the north of Argentina and south of Bolivia. Our method is robust with respect to the parameters used to define the extreme events (the percentile threshold and the run length) and the length of the sub-seasonal time window (here 2?4 weeks). This procedure could also be used to identify temporal clustering of other variables (e.g. heat waves) and can be applied on different time scales (sub-seasonal to decadal).

Rasmussen and Robert J. Trapp and Qinghong Zhang";"Hailstorms are dangerous and costly phenomena that are expected to change in response to a warming climate. In this Review, we summarize current knowledge of climate change effects on hailstorms. As a result of anthropogenic warming, it is generally anticipated that low-level moisture and convective instability will increase, raising hailstorm likelihood and enabling the formation of larger hailstones; the melting height will rise, enhancing hail melt and increasing the average size of surviving hailstones; and vertical wind shear will decrease overall, with limited influence on the overall hailstorm activity, owing to a predominance of other factors. Given geographic differences and offsetting interactions in these projected environmental changes, there is spatial heterogeneity in hailstorm responses. Observations and modelling lead to the general expectation that hailstorm frequency will increase in Australia and Europe, but decrease in East Asia and North America, while hail severity will increase in most regions. However, these projected changes show marked spatial and temporal variability. Owing to a dearth of long-term observations, as well as incomplete process understanding and limited convection-permitting modelling studies, current and future climate change effects on hailstorms remain highly uncertain. Future studies should focus on detailed processes and account for non-stationarities in proxy relationships.";2021;"hailstorms, climate, change, frequency, uncertainty"

Readily extractable inorganic and microbial soil phosphorus (P) pools may be affected due to rapid changes in soil water availability. We aimed to determine how soil P dynamics are affected by repeated soil DRW using a sandy grassland soil that regularly experiences DRW. In a laboratory soil incubation study, the soil was exposed to three DRW cycles, with each cycle consisting of a two-day drying phase, a three-day dryness phase and a four-day moist phase after rapid rewetting. The indicators of abiotic processes (P sorption) and biotic processes (respiration, microbial abundance, potential phosphatase enzyme activities) were regularly determined together with water-extractable P, resin-extractable P and microbial P in a 33P-labelled soil. During the first DRW cycle, microbial P was reduced by half and accompanied by a concomitant but not equivalent increase in water-extractable P and a slight as well as delayed increase in resin-extractable P. Thus, increases in water-extractable P were explained by microbial P released during drying but also by microbial P occupying soil P sorption sites, thereby decreasing soil P sorption. Changes in the 33P-isotopic composition of microbial P at the same time suggested that microorganisms did not respond homogenously to the DRW treat- ment and indicated an increased mineralisation of previously unavailable organic P compounds. However, during the second and third DRW cycles, only water-extractable P, soil P sorption and potential phosphatase activities were affected by the DRW treatment, whereas all other parameters remained similar in values to the constant moist treatment. The effects of DRW on soil P dynamics appeared to affect water-extractable P more long-lastingly, whereas microbial P and most of the biotic indicators quickly adjusted to the DRW treatment. We conclude that the current concepts suggesting an increased mobility of soil P towards other environmental compartments due to soil DRW should consider that abiotic and biotic soil P dynamics are not equally affected in the case of short repetition of DRW incidences.";2021;"soil, drying, rewetting, phosphorus, dynamics"

Despite this, national and subnational energy policies often neglect biomass cooking fuels. A Formative Scenario Analysis process is applied to show how the cooking fuel sector in Kilimanjaro Region (Tanzania) and Kitui County (Kenya) might evolve by 2030. In order to provide relevant knowledge for potential energy policies, this paper aims to identify the main drivers impacting the cooking fuel sector, and to assess and explore current and future demand and supply potential of biomass cooking fuels. Our results show that policies have the potential to substantially impact the future mix of cooking fuels and to foster or hamper the use of efficient cooking fuel technologies. Half of Kilimanjaro Region?s households could be supplied with biogas; in Kitui County, wood-based cooking fuels is likely to remain dominant but improving the efficiency of the technologies would reduce the demand for wood considerably. Hence, we argue that energy policies should explicitly consider biomass cooking fuels and endeavour to make this sector more sustainable and that priority should be given to increasing the sustainability of the biomass cooking fuel sector. Key leverage points to do so are improving the access to improved biomass technologies and capacity building.";2021;"households, biomass, fuel, policies, technologies"

Here, we study the effects of recurrent synoptic- scale transient Rossby wave packets (RRWPs) on the persistence of dry and wet spells using the ERA- Interim reanalysis data. RRWPs significantly alter (decrease and increase) dry and wet spell persistence across the globe. Spatial patterns of statistically significant links between RRWPs and spell durations arise from the superposition of a zonally symmetric component and a wave-like component that is modulated by local factors such as orography and the position relative to major moisture sources. The zonally symmetric component is apparent during the Northern Hemisphere winter and dominates the Southern Hemisphere signal in winter and summer. The wave-like component appears primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, changes its wavenumber with the season and is thus, conceivably related to stationary wave dynamics.";2021;"dry, wet, spells, RRWPs, persistence"

Depending on extensive measurement networks, high-resolution air temperature measurements in urban environments are challenging due to high instrumentation and maintenance costs. Here, we present a low-cost measurement device (LCD) consisting of a temperature logger and a custom-made, naturally ventilated radiation shield. Besides intercomparisons with automated weather stations (AWS) at three reference sites during record-dry summer 2018, we tested the potential of the devices using a network of 79 LCDs to assess the intra-urban variability of urban heat island (UHI) patterns in the city of Bern, Switzerland. We found positive mean measurement biases between LCDs and AWS of 0.61 to 0.93 K (RMSE: 0.78 to 1.17 K) during daytime, of which up to 82.8% of the variance could be explained statistically by solar irradiance (radiative heating) and wind speed (insufficient ventilation). During night, average measurement biases were markedly lower and eventually negative with -0.12 to 0.23 K (RMSE: 0.19 to 0.34 K). Our results highlight the importance of sensor intercomparisons being conducted at multiple locations with differing urban land-cover, structure, and metabolism given that biases varied considerably between the reference sites. Data retrieved by the city-wide measurement network showed that the LCD approach is well suited for the analysis of spatiotemporal UHI patterns during night and adds considerable value compared to the few existing AWS in detecting fine-scale air temperature variability. In conclusion, the current LCD measurement approach represents a valuable option for cost-effective analyses of urban air temperature variability across multiple scales, which may be of particular value for the development, appliance, and monitoring of adaptation strategies to climate change in cities with restricted financial resources.";2021;"urban, temperature, measurement, variability, low-cost"

To date, LDN operationalization at the country level has remained a challenge both from a policy and science perspective. Using an approach incorporating cloud?based geospatial computing with machine learning, national level datasets of land cover, land productivity dynamics, and soil organic carbon stocks were developed. Using the example of Botswana, LDN and proportion of degraded land were assessed. Between 2000 and 2015, grassland lost approximately 17% of its original extent, the highest level of loss for any land category; land productivity decline was highest in artificial surface areas (11%), whereas 36% of croplands show early signs of decline. With the use of national metrics (NM), degraded areas were found to be 32.6% compared to 51.4% of the total land area when global default datasets (DD) were used. Estimates of degraded land computed with NM and DD were validated in Palapye, an agro?pastoral region in eastern Botswana, where Composite Land Degradation Index (CLDI) field?based data exists. Comparing land degradation (LD) in the three datasets (NM, DD, and CLDI), NM estimates were closest to the field data. The extra efforts put into developing national level data for LD assessment in this study is, thus, well?justified. Beyond demonstrating remote sensing viability for LD assessment, the study developed procedures for generating and validating national level datasets. Using these procedures, LD monitoring will be enhanced in Botswana and elsewhere since these remote sensing datasets can be updated using freely available satellite datasets.";2021;"land degradation neutrality, operationalization, geospatial, botswana, validation"

Here, interlinked experiments (field manuring and soil batch culture) were conducted to find the effect of organic matter at a field application rate practiced in Bangladesh (5 t/ha) on As mobilization in soil for paddies impacted by As contaminated groundwater irrigation, a wide- spread phenomenon in Bangladesh where the experiments were conducted. Total As concentration in a paddy soil (Sonargaon) ranged from 21.9 to 8.1 mg/kg down the soil profile and strongly correlated with TOC content. Arsenic, Fe, Mn, and DOC release into soil solution, and As speciation, are intimately linked to OM amendment, soil depth and temporal variation. Organic matter amendments lead to increased mobilization of As into both soil porewaters and standing surface waters. The As speciation in the porewater was dominated by inorganic As (Asi) (arsenite and arsenate), with traces amounts of meth- ylated species (DMAV and MMAV) only being found with OM amendment. It was noted in field trials that OM fertilization greatly enhanced As mobility to surface waters, which may have major implications for the fate of As in paddy agronomic ecosystems.";2021;"fertilization, arsenic, organic, mobilization, soil"

Longer-term trends and year-to-year variability of precipitation or temperature severely affect living conditions. This study evaluates seasonal precipitation and temperature climatologies and trends in the period 1965/66?2017/18 for the southern Peruvian Andes using quality-controlled and homogenized station data and new observational gridded data. In this region, precipitation exhibits a strong annual cycle with very dry winter months and most of the precipitation falling from spring to autumn. Spatially, a northeast?southwest gradient in austral spring is observed, related to an earlier start of the rainy season in the northeastern partof the study area. Seasonal variations of maximum temperature are weak withan annual maximum in austral spring, which is related to reduced cloud coverin austral spring compared to summer. On the contrary, minimum tempera-tures show larger seasonal variations, possibly enhanced through changes inlongwave incoming radiation following the precipitation cycle. Precipitationtrends since 1965 exhibit low spatial consistency except for austral summer,when in most of the study area increasing precipitation is observed, and in aus-tral spring, when stations in the central-western region of the study area regis-ter decreasing precipitation. All seasonal and annual trends in maximum temperature are larger than trends in minimum temperature. Maximum temperature exhibits strong trends in austral winter and spring, whereas minimum temperature trends are strongest in austral winter. We hypothesize, that these trends are related to precipitation changes, as decreasing (increasing) precipita-tion in spring (summer) may enhance maximum (minimum) temperature trends through changes in cloud cover.

This change is particularly pronounced in Myanmar, whose economy is developing at great speed after the end of decades-long economic and political isolation and armed conflicts. Interventions are needed to ensure that development is sustainable. Designing successful interventions requires spatially explicit knowledge of recent landscape changes. To provide such knowledge, we applied a landscape mosaic approach and analysed land system change in Tanintharyi Region in southern Myanmar between 2002 and 2016. Our findings show that nearly half of the study region experienced degradation of the vegetation cover, intensification of agricultural use, or a combination of both. Although intact forest was still the prevailing vegetation cover of land systems in Tanintharyi Region in 2016, it had suffered from degradation in wide parts of the region. Land systems without or with only extensive agricultural use in 2002 had become dominated by smallholders? shifting cultivation systems and permanent betel nut gardens and paddy rice fields by 2016. Elsewhere, smallholder dominated land systems were intensified through the expansion of oil palm and rubber plantations, pointing to potential displacement effects. The land system maps offer a sound basis for planning interventions to slow the degradation of biodiversity-rich forests and support smallholder farmers in coping with the fast-paced expansion of commercial cash crop plantations and its social and environmental impacts.

For water resources management, the seasonal patterns of discharge in alpine areas are particularly relevant, as the shift to lower flows in summer and autumn combined with increased water demand could lead to water shortage in downstream catchments. The storage of groundwater in alpine catchments could significantly modulate how changing climatic conditions influence the annual streamflow regime. However, groundwater storage and its buffering capacity in alpine areas remain poorly understood. Moreover, studies on how climate change will impact water resources in alpine areas rarely consider the influence of geology. In this paper, catchment geology is used as a basis for the classification of future summer low flows behavior of several alpine catchments in Switzerland. Based on the analysis of the relationship between low-flow indicators and geology, the role of unconsolidated quaternary deposits is explored. We show that quaternary deposits play a critical role in the seasonal storage of groundwater, which can contribute to rivers during low-flow periods. Three climate change simulations based on extreme RCP 8.5 scenarios are fed into a conceptual hydrological model to illustrate the buffering role of groundwater. Past and future low flows normalized by mean past and future streamflows appear correlated with the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits. These results highlight that catchments with high groundwater contribution to streamflow relative to precipitation will have a slower decrease in future summer discharge. Therefore, we propose two indicators that can be used to anticipate the response of future summers low flows in alpine areas to climate change: the current winter low flows and the percentage of unconsolidated quaternary deposits of the catchments.";2021;"vulnerable, discharge, groundwater, geology, future"

Studying compound events often requires a multidisciplinary approach combining domain knowledge of the underlying processes with, for example, statistical methods and climate model outputs. Recently, to aid the development of research on compound events, four compound event types were introduced, namely (a) preconditioned, (b) multivariate, (c) temporally compounding, and (d) spatially compounding events. However, guidelines on how to study these types of events are still lacking. Here, we consider four case studies, each associated with a specific event type and a research question, to illustrate how the key elements of compound events (e.g., analytical tools and relevant physical effects) can be identified. These case studies show that (a) impacts on crops from hot and dry summers can be exacerbated by preconditioning effects of dry and bright springs. (b) Assessing compound coastal flooding in Perth (Australia) requires considering the dynamics of a non-stationary multivariate process. For instance, future mean sea-level rise will lead to the emergence of concurrent coastal and fluvial extremes, enhancing compound flooding risk. (c) In Portugal, deep-landslides are often caused by temporal clusters of moderate precipitation events. Finally, (d) crop yield failures in France and Germany are strongly correlated, threatening European food security through spatially compounding effects. These analyses allow for identifying general recommendations for studying compound events. Overall, our insights can serve as a blueprint for compound event analysis across disciplines and sectors.";2021;"compound, events, multidisciplinary, types, case"

To the formal market, the informal market is illegitimate as it infringes on formal property rights and planning regulations, whereas to the informal market, the formal market is illegitimate due to its excluding nature.

In this study, we use max-stable models to study extreme daily precipitation events in Switzerland. The non-stationarity of the spatial process at hand involves important challenges, which are often dealt with by using a stationary model in a so-called climate space, with well-chosen covariates. Here, we instead choose to warp the weather stations under study in a latent space of higher dimension using multidimensional scaling (MDS). Two methods are proposed to define target dissimilarity matrices, based respectively on extremal coefficients and on pairwise likelihoods.

In-depth interviews conducted with residents in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales four years after they were affected by the October 2013 bushfires show that insurance was fundamental to recovery.

Considering several factors of supply, demand and flow and focusing on local stakeholders, we developed nine ES models using Bayesian networks and applied them in different land scenarios in Myanmar?s Tanintharyi Region. We found land use and tenure as well as demand for specific products to be the key factors determining final ES outcomes. While forested lands have high regulating and overall balanced ES bundles, mixed agricultural lands provide subsistence and commercial products as well as better environmental education opportunities. By contrast, commercial agricultural concessions strongly limit ES outcomes for local communities. As our models reveal more distinct impacts of land policy scenarios in a homogeneous setting, where demand is better accounted for, we recommend their use for spatially explicit analyses of forest frontier landscapes.";2021;"tropical, frontier, models, land, factors"

Cover crops and tillage reduction can increase sustainability, but it is not known whether stimulation of the soil microbial commu- nity can increase the availability of soil organic P pools.

Microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), P cycling enzymes, and carbon-substrate use capacity were linked for the first time with the lability of organic P pools measured by enzyme addition assays (using phosphodi- esterase, non-phytase-phosphomonoesterase and fungal phytase). Results Microbial phosphorus, phosphatase, and fatty acids increased under cover crops, indicating an en- hanced potential for organic P cycling. Enzyme-stable organic P shifted towards enzyme-labile organic P pools. Effects of no-till were weaker, and a synergy with cover crops was not evident.

It usually relies on predictors describing the atmospheric circulation and the moisture content of the atmosphere to sample similar meteorological situations in the past and establish a probabilistic forecast for a target date. AMs can be based on outputs from numerical weather prediction models in the context of operational forecasting or outputs from climate models in climatic applications.AMs can be constituted of multiple predictors organized in different subsequent levels of analogy that refines the selection of similar situations. The development of such methods is usually a manual process where some predictors are assessed in different structures. As most AMs use multiple predictors, a comprehensive assessment of all combinations becomes quickly impossible. The selection of predictors in the application of the AM often builds on previous work and does not evolve much. However, the climate models providing the predictors evolve continuously and new variables might become relevant to be considered in AMs. Moreover, the best predictors might change from one region to another or for another predictand of interest. There is a need for a method to automatically explore potential variables for AMs and to extract the ones that are relevant for a predictand of interest.We propose using genetic algorithms (GAs) to proceed to an automatic selection of the predictor variables along with all other parameters of the AM. We even let the GAs automatically pick the best analogy criteria, i.e. the metric that quantifies the analogy between two situations. The first test consisted of letting the GAs select the single best variable to predict daily precipitation for each of 25 selected catchments in Switzerland. The results showed great consistency in terms of spatial patterns and the underlying meteorological processes. Then, different structures were assessed by varying the number of levels of analogy and the number of variables per level. Finally, multiple optimizations were conducted on the 25 catchments to identify the 12 variables that provide the best prediction when considered together.";2021;"analog, downscaling, predictors, genetic algorithms, automatic"

However, whether PAs manage to achieve their objectives is not always clear, nor are the implications of PA establishment for the supply of ES relevant for local populations. To address these knowledge gaps, we assess the year-to-year supply of six stakeholder-relevant ES across ES categories in two forest frontier, mountainous landscapes in the periphery of PAs in north-eastern Madagascar. As ES most relevant to local populations, we assess food crops production, flood control and bequest value. As globally-demanded ES, we evaluate export cash crops production, global climate regulation and existence value. Our results suggest that PA implementation managed to stem on-going losses of global climate regulation and existence value, but at the expense of also driving decreases in food crops production and bequest value supply to local populations. While our findings are encouraging for global conservation objectives, they also highlight the stark costs local populations might incur under PA establishment, and thus the need to assure that local livelihoods and well-being, including cultural dimensions, are not undermined by conservation interventions.";2021;"tropical, mountains, es, supply, populations"

The reconstruction of long-term hypolimnetic anoxia records can be challenging due to lack of valid and easily measurable proxies.  The sedimentary Mn/Fe ratio measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is often used as a proxy for past lake redox conditions. Yet the interpretation of this ratio can be problematic when Fe and Mn accumulation is not solely redox driven. We used the varved sediments of Lake Moossee (Switzerland) to examine the partitioning of Fe and Mn in seven fractions by sequential extraction under various oxygen conditions over the last 15,000 years. We combined this data with XRF scans and an independent diagnostic proxy for anoxia given by a hyperspectral imaging (HSI)-inferred record of bacteriopheophytin, to validate the use of the XRF-Mn/Fe ratio as redox proxy. In the 15,000-year long record, Fe was bound to humins and amorphous, crystalline, sulfide and residual forms. Mn was mainly present in carbonate and amorphous forms. Higher erosion, prolonged anoxia, diagenesis and humic matter input affected Fe and Mn accumulation. Under holomixis the XRF-Mn/Fe ratio successfully reflected lake redox conditions. Periods with higher detrital Fe input obscured the applicability of the ratio. During phases of permanent anoxia, intensified early diagenetic processes trapped Mn in the sediments in carbonate, crystalline oxide and humic forms. Our study shows that the single use of the XRF-Mn/Fe ratio is often not conclusive for inferring past lake redox conditions. The application of the XRF-Mn/Fe as a proxy for anoxia requires taking into account the individual lake characteristics and changes in lake environmental conditions, which affect the accumulation of Fe and Mn in the sediments.";2021;"anoxia, proxy, lake, redox, accumulation"

Recently, the number of studies that use distributed post-flood observation data collected throughout flood-affected communities (e.g. face-to-face interviews) are increasing. However, a systematic method that applies such data for hydrodynamic modelling of past floods in locations without hydrological is lacking. In this study, we developed a method for reconstructing plausible scenarios of past flood events in data-scarce regions by applying flood observation data collected through field interviews to a hydrodynamic model (CAESAR-Lisflood). We tested the method using 300 spatially distributed flood depths and duration data collected using questionnaires on five river reaches after the 2017 flood event in Suleja and Tafa region, Nigeria.

However, the scarcity of empirical data has limited flood damage modeling in several regions. As a result, studies in data-scarce regions have mostly been restricted to either building exposure assessment or identification of vulnerability indicators without a further linkage to probable damage. As expert-based approaches do not require empirical damage data, they have a high potential for flood damage modeling in data-scarce regions. In this study, we carried out a comparative assessment between an expert-based and a data-driven approach. The expert-based approach systematically combines the vulnerability indicator method and synthetic what-if analysis based on the knowledge of regional experts. The data-driven approach integrates empirical flood damage data in the analysis applying a multivariate random forest model. Flood damage data, collected through interviews after two flood events in 2017 and 2019 at separate locations in Nigeria, were used to evaluate the performance of both methods based on developed damage grades. Results from both methods showed i) a predictive accuracy of 30% and 38% for the expert-based and data-driven approaches respectively, ii) that distance to channel, wall material, building condition, and building quality are significant regional damage drivers, and iii) comparable model performance can be achieved even with a reduced number of variables. Furthermore, the study demonstrated how experts are likely to underestimate damage at low water depths and how a difference in conformity to building standards can add to challenges in flood damage prediction.";2021;"damage, flood, expert-based, data-driven, vulnerability"

Schaffner and Sandra Eckert";"Trees of the genus Prosopis from the Americas, were introduced in Eastern Africa in the 1970s to mitigate land degradation and its associated disservices. However, over time these trees have spread and invaded valuable grasslands and croplands and consequently led to significant land use and land cover (LULC) changes and livelihood stress. Early detection of invasive species is essential for formulating effective management strategies to prevent further spread into non-invaded lands and for monitoring the outcome of management interventions. We mapped the spatio-temporal evolution and dynamics of Prosopis invasion, its impacts on LULC and livelihoods in Baringo, Kenya by applying a Random Forest classifier on Landsat satellite data over seven-year intervals from 1988 - 2016. We then linked the LULC changes to soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks that we had measured for the different LULCs and also to socio-economic data on annual costs of clearing Prosopis from farmlands. By 2016, Prosopis had invaded 18,792 ha of land, spreading at a rate of 640 ha/yr, while all other land uses and land cover declined, each by over 40% of its original coverage in 1988. Through LULC specific SOC measurements, and relating the changes to annual costs of clearing Prosopis, we found that Prosopis removal and restoration to grassland is more effective for climate change mitigation compared to Prosopis ?cultivation? while also avoiding trade-offs with other ecosystem services and livelihoods. Therefore, future management of this species in Kenya and Eastern Africa should be based on a more collaborative and integrated approach.";2021;"prosopis, invasion, LULC, impacts, management"

We searched the peer-reviewed literature and selected only studies that compare ES from SF with ES from other land uses. In total, 212 ES and 347 comparisons of different land use systems were recorded. Comparisons were mainly made for carbon storage, biodiversity, and soil variables. Very few provisioning ES were compared in the literature and no cultural services were recorded. SF were in most cases inferior to old-growth forest in terms of carbon storage and biodiversity, whereas soil quality comparisons varied. ES provision in SF was superior to agricultural systems, whereas comparisons with plantation crops varied. We conclude that the narrow focus on specific ES categories strongly limits understanding of SF in shifting cultivation areas and that it is more relevant to compare SFs with other agricultural systems rather than with old-growth forests.";2021;"secondary, forests, ecosystem, services, comparison"

"796";"River runoff in Switzerland in a changing climate ? runoff regime changes and their time of emergence";"Regula Isabelle M{\"u";"Assessments of climate change impacts on runoff regimes are essential to climate change adaptation and mitigation planning. Changing runoff regimes and thus changing seasonal patterns of water availability strongly influence various economic sectors such as agriculture, energy production, and fishery and also affect river ecology. In this study, we use new transient hydrological scenarios driven by the most up-to-date local climate projections for Switzerland, the Swiss Climate Change Scenarios. These provide detailed information on changes in runoff regimes and their time of emergence for 93 rivers in Switzerland under three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5. These transient scenarios also allow changes to be framed as a function of global mean temperature.  The new projections for seasonal runoff changes largely confirm the sign of changes in runoff from previous hydrological scenarios with increasing winter runoff and decreasing summer and autumn runoff. Spring runoff is projected to increase in high-elevation catchments and to decrease in lower-lying catchments. Despite the increases in winter and some increases in spring, the annual mean runoff is projected to decrease in most catchments. Compared to lower-lying catchments, runoff changes in high-elevation catchments (above 1500-m-a.s.l.) are larger in winter, spring, and summer due to the large influence of reduced snow accumulation and earlier snowmelt and glacier melt. The changes in runoff and the agreement between climate models on the sign of change both increase with increasing global mean temperatures and higher-emission scenarios. This amplification highlights the importance of climate change mitigation.  The time of emergence is the time when the climate signal emerges significantly from natural variability. Under RCP8.5, times of emergence were found early, before the period 2036?2065, in winter and summer for catchments with mean altitudes above 1500-m-a.s.l. Significant changes in catchments below 1500-m-a.s.l. emerge later in the century. Not all catchments show significant changes in the distribution of seasonal means; thus, no time of emergence could be determined in these catchments. Furthermore, the significant changes of seasonal mean runoff are not persistent over time in some catchments due to nonlinear changes in runoff.";2021;"climate, runoff, switzerland, scenarios, emergence"

This study used the concept of a knowledge system to examine how organizational collaboration, in the processes of forecast translation, influences the production of useable information in forest-based climate change interventions in South Africa. Twenty-two key informant interviews were conducted with actors in the fields of climate change and forestry. Results reveal that carbon sequestration and landscape management are the dominant forest-based climate interventions. Consequently, the information translated from the forecasts is tailored towards facilitating the implementation of these two interventions. Network analysis reveals that actors in the categories of small-scale forest companies and community-based enterprises are less integrated into the process of information production. A concerted effort towards the meaningful integration of all categories of actors in the process of information production, as well as the production of information that encourages the implementation of other types of forest-based climate change interventions such as forest bioenergy, is thus recommended.";2021;"knowledge, systems, collaboration, information, actors"

The Canary Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME) is characterised by a mix of the Atlantic Ocean basin waters, reverse flow from the Mediterranean Sea, and inland waters from adjacent countries. This biodiversity-rich ecosystem is a source of ecosystem goods and services that provide sustenance for populations in the coastal states of West Africa and beyond. However, with the ocean surface warming, ocean productivity and fisheries? outputs have declined across multiple trophic levels. Therefore, in this diagnostic study based on a systematic literature review (publications from 2009 to 2020), we (a) provide an integrative assessment of the CCLME with the exception of Morocco, in the context of the modular large marine ecosystem framework using the categories ?environmental? (productivity, fish and fisheries, pollution, and ecosystem health) and ?non-environmental? (socioeconomic and governance), and (b) identify knowledge gaps and data scarce regions. The key drivers of change in the CCLME were identified as fishing pressure, land-based pollution, coastal habitat loss, and climate change. Productivity, land-based pollution, and ecosystem health were priority areas for data collection in the CCLME, with data deficiencies particularly apparent in The Gambia and Guinea. Therefore, to mitigate further degradation and accelerate progress toward sustainable management of the CCLME, research should be conducted in these priority areas of data deficiency. Furthermore, as most drivers of change in this ecosystem are related to weak management and a lack of regulatory enforcement, we recommend effective implementation, monitoring, and enforcement of existing national and transboundary regulations, as well as ecosystem-based human-centred management approaches, as proactive strategies for decoupling anthropogenic disturbances from climate change and optimising the productivity of the CCLME.";2021;"exports, pollutants, biodiversity, productivity, management"

The results indicate that the simulations underestimated the occurrence of severe and very large hail compared to the observations.

We present a conceptual model to guide the implementation of environmental transdisciplinary work, which we consider a ?science with society? (SWS) approach, providing suggested activities to conduct throughout a seven-step process. We used a survey with 168 respondents involved in environmental transdisciplinary work worldwide to evaluate the relative importance of these activities and the skills and characteristics required to implement them successfully, with attention to how responses differed according to the gender, geographic location, and positionality of the respondents. Flexibility and collaborative spirit were the most frequently valued skills in SWS, though non-researchers tended to prioritize attributes like humility, trust, and patience over flexibility. We also explored the relative significance of barriers to successful SWS, finding insufficient time and unequal power dynamics were the two most significant barriers to successful SWS. Together with case studies of respondents? most successful SWS projects, we create a toolbox of 20 best practices that can be used to overcome barriers and increase the societal and scientific impacts of SWS projects. Project success was perceived to be significantly higher where there was medium to high policy impact, and projects initiated by practitioners/other stakeholders had a larger proportion of high policy impact compared to projects initiated by researchers only. Communicating project results to academic audiences occurred more frequently than communicating results to practitioners or the public, despite this being ranked less important overall. We discuss how these results point to three recommendations for future SWS: 1) balancing diverse perspectives through careful partnership formation and design; 2) promoting communication, learning, and reflexivity (i.e., questioning assumptions, beliefs, and practices) to overcome conflict and power asymmetries; and 3) increasing policy impact for joint science and society benefits. Our study highlights the benefits of diversity in SWS - both in the types of people and knowledge included as well as the methods used - and the potential benefits of this approach for addressing the increasingly complex challenges arising from global environmental change.";2021;"transdisciplinary, sustainability, implementation, skills, barriers"

This robust fingerprint of climate change is of particular concern, resulting in heavy rainfall and devastating floods. Often this intensification is explained as a consequence of the Clausius?Clapeyron law in a warmer world, under constant relative humidity. Here, based on an ensemble of CMIP5 global climate models and high-resolution regional climate simulations, we take the example of Southwest Asia, where extreme storms will intensify beyond the Clausius- Clapeyron scaling, and propose an additional novel mechanism for this region: the unique increase in atmospheric relative humidity over the Arabian Sea and associated deep northward penetration of moisture. This increase in humidity is dictated by changes in circulation over the Indian Ocean. Our proposed mechanism is consistent with the recent, most extreme storm ever observed in the region. Our findings advance a new understanding of natural climate variability in this region, with substantial implications for climate change adaptation of the region?s critical infrastructure.";2021;"precipitation, extremes, warming, humidity, storms"

In a recent study, we explained the projected winter precipitation decline over the Mediterranean under climate change as due to shifts in upper tropospheric stationary waves and to the regional-scale land?water warming contrast. Here, based on the analysis of observations and output from models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, we expand this theory further, documenting how the winter precipitation decline expands into southern Europe during spring, dictated by similar dynamical mechanisms, depleting soil moisture and setting the stage for drier summers via soil moisture?precipitation feedbacks. Over northwestern Europe, an anomalous anticyclonic circulation west of the British Isles displaces the low-level moisture jet northward, limiting moisture supply, and reducing low-level relative humidity and rainfall. Finally, we discuss how this comprehensive perspective of European summer climate change can help us better understand the variations across model projections, and pave the way for their reduction.";2021;"geography, climate, precipitation, europe, moisture"

Here, we apply a simple statistical framework based on Ripley?s K function, at a global scale and for each season separately, to identify regions where precipitation extremes tend to cluster in time over timescales of a few days to a few weeks. We analyze several observational and reanalysis datasets, as well as output from CMIP6 Global Climate Models (GCMs). Good agreement is found on the spatio-temporal clustering patterns across datasets. Sub-seasonal temporal clustering is largely concentrated over the tropical oceans, where it can be detected year-round. It is also significant over certain tropical lands, like Eastern Africa, and seasonally outside the tropics in several regions, most notably around the eastern subtropical oceans (Iberian Peninsula and Western North America during the DJF and MAM seasons) Southwest Asia (especially during JJA and SON) and Australia (in SON). We also find that CMIP6 models generally correctly reproduce clustering patterns, paving the way for an assessment of trends in sub-seasonal clustering under climate change. Clustering of present-day extremes increases in many areas under climate change. Changes diagnosed by comparing present day and future extreme percentiles are positive and negative and strongest in the tropical areas.";2021;"occurrence, impact, precipitation, clustering, climate"

While applying an analytical framework based on environmental justice, we perform a cross-analysis of the city-wide greening strategies, together with a peculiar and unusual planning process for a new green space in the neighbourhood of Marvila. Based on qualitative research carried out in-situ, we argue that Lisbon?s greening strategies are based on a discourse of ecological benefits, without aiming to ensure access to green space for different population groups. Procedural justice concerns are widely undervalued, resulting in limited space available for community involvement. We show how urban greening is essentially a multiscalar exercise, impacted by and affecting multiple scales simultaneously. Hence procedural justice deserves a much more prominent role in urban greening, as participation and recognition can give local communities the opportunity to adapt global urban agendas toward their particular needs and desires. Our findings lead us to conclude that environmental justice is ultimately an exercise of multiscalar governance, where local decision-making needs to attend to contextual challenges but also to a long-term sustainability vision at a larger scale.";2021;"urban, greening, lisbon, justice, scale"
"835";"Identifying meteorological drivers of extreme impacts: an application to simulated crop yields";"Johannes Vogel and Pauline Marie Cl{'e";"Compound weather events may lead to extreme impacts that can affect many aspects of society including agriculture. Identifying the underlying mechanisms that cause extreme impacts, such as crop failure, is of crucial importance to improve their understanding and forecasting. In this study, we investigate whether key meteorological drivers of extreme impacts can be identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in a model environment, a method that allows for automated variable selection and is able to handle collinearity between variables. As an example of an extreme impact, we investigate crop failure using annual wheat yield as simulated by the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) crop model driven by 1600 years of daily weather data from a global climate model (EC-Earth) under present-day conditions for the Northern Hemisphere. We then apply LASSO logistic regression to determine which weather conditions during the growing season lead to crop failure. We obtain good model performance in central Europe and the eastern half of the United States, while crop failure years in regions in Asia and the western half of the United States are less accurately predicted. Model performance correlates strongly with annual mean and variability of crop yields; that is, model performance is highest in regions with relatively large annual crop yield mean and variability. Overall, for nearly all grid points, the inclusion of temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure deficit is key to predict crop failure. In addition, meteorological predictors during all seasons are required for a good prediction. These results illustrate the omnipresence of compounding effects of both meteorological drivers and different periods of the growing season for creating crop failure events. Especially vapour pressure deficit and climate extreme indicators such as diurnal temperature range and the number of frost days are selected by the statistical model as relevant predictors for crop failure at most grid points, underlining their overarching relevance. We conclude that the LASSO regression model is a useful tool to automatically detect compound drivers of extreme impacts and could be applied to other weather impacts such as wildfires or floods. As the detected relationships are of purely correlative nature, more detailed analyses are required to establish the causal structure between drivers and impacts.";2021;"extreme, meteorological, crop, failure, lasso"

White and Kai Kornhuber and Olivia Romppainen-Martius and Volkmar Wirth";"A notable number of high impact weather extremes have occurred in recent years, often associated with persistent, strongly meandering atmospheric circulation patterns known as Rossby waves. Because of the high societal and ecosystem impacts, it is of great interest to be able to accurately project how such extreme events will change with climate change, and to predict these events on seasonal to subseasonal (S2S) timescales. There are multiple physical links connecting upper atmosphere circulation patterns to surface weather extremes, and it is asking a lot of our dynamical models to accurately simulate all of these. Subsequently, our confidence in future projections and S2S forecasts of extreme events connected to Rossby waves remains relatively low. We also lack full fundamental theories for the growth and propagation of Rossby waves on the spatial and temporal scales relevant to extreme events, particularly under strongly non-linear conditions. By focussing on one of the first links in the chain from upper atmospheric conditions to surface extremes -- the Rossby waveguide -- it may be possible to circumvent some model biases in later links. To further our understanding of the nature of waveguides, links to persistent surface weather events and their representation in models, we recommend: exploring these links in model hierarchies of increasing complexity, developing fundamental theory, exploiting novel large ensemble data sets, harnessing deep learning, and increased community collaboration. This would help increase understanding and confidence in both S2S predictions of extremes and of projections of the impact of climate change on extreme weather events.";2021;"extreme, weather, rossby, waveguides, models"

The spatial transferability of empirical vulnerability functions is limited, leading to the need for computation and validation of region-specific vulnerability functions. In data-scarce regions however, this option is not feasible. In contrast, the physical processes of flood impact model chains can be developed in these regions because of the availability of global datasets. Here we evaluated the implementation of a synthetic vulnerability function into a flood impact model. The function bases on expert heuristics on a targeted sample of representative buildings (targeted heuristics). We applied the vulnerability function in a meso-scale river basin and evaluated the new function by comparing the resulting flood damage with the damage computed by other approaches, (1) an ensemble of vulnerability functions available from the literature, (2) an individual vulnerability function calibrated with region-specific data, and (3) the vulnerability function used in flood risk management by the Swiss government. The results show that targeted heuristics can be a valuable alternative for developing flood impact models in regions without any data or only few data on flood damage.";2021;"vulnerability, flood, impact, function, region"

Typically, simulations from climate models are used to assess future risks, but it is largely unknown how well the current generation of models represents compound extremes. Here, we introduce a new metric that measures whether the tails of bivariate distributions show a similar dependence structure across different datasets. We analyse com-pound precipitation and wind extremes in reanalysis data and different high-resolution simulations for central Europe. A state-of-the-art reanalysis dataset (ERA5) is compared to simulations with a weather model (Weather Research and Forecasting ? WRF) either driven by observation-based boundary conditions or a global circulation model (Community Earth System Model ? CESM) under present-day and future conditions with strong greenhouse gas forcing (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 ? RCP8.5). Over the historical period, the high-resolution WRF simulations capture precipitation and wind extremes as well as their response to orographic effects more realistically than ERA5. Thus, WRF simulations driven by observation-based boundary conditions are used as a benchmark for evaluating the dependence structure of wind and precipitation extremes. Overall, boundary conditions in WRF appear to be the key factor in explaining differences in the dependence behaviour between strong wind and heavy precipitation between simulations. In comparison, external forcings (RCP8.5) are of second order. Our approach offers new methodological tools to evaluate climate model simulations with respect to compound extremes.";2021;"climate, extremes, dependence, simulations, precipitation"

This paper draws on findings from a research project that set out to examine the role of insurance in household recovery after the 2013 Blue Mountains bushfires in New South Wales. Among the 19 interview participants, prioritisation of the needs of children was found to hinder personal recovery. Drawing on this key finding, this paper focuses on parents' emotion work and emotions surrounding home. Innate desires to provide good care monopolised parents' emotions and emotional outlets, as they worked to conceal threats and (re)establish a sense of normalcy. Emotion work drained parents, as did threats to, and the loss of, ?home? created through ?dwelling.? When homes burnt, so too did memories of children embodied in that home ? memories that had permeated the material space. This sense of loss intensified when informing children about losses ? an act that breached parents' protective instincts and necessitated additional emotional care. Emotions escalated as capacities for care were challenged or eroded in the absence of home contents that normally would have anchored daily routines and provided stability. Replacing such items dominated parents' recovery efforts ? efforts encumbered by competing recovery demands, yet facilitated to some degree by insurance safety-nets. These emotions impacted parents' mental and physical wellbeing in the four years that separated the bushfires and the interviews. While there is considerable literature outlining parents' role in lessening disaster impacts on children, few studies examine parents' capacity to do so. In addressing this gap, this paper highlights avenues to improve psychosocial aspects of disaster recovery.";2021;"disasters, recovery, emotions, parents, insurance"

However, studies that explicitly address the causative role of culture in land systems have been fairly limited relative to those examining other structural dimensions (e.g. markets, policies, climate). In this paper, we aim to start a discussion on how to better include culture in LSS. Through four examples, we show how aspects of culture influence land systems in myriad ways. Building on existing causal land system models, we propose a conceptual framework for the role of culture in land use and summarize promising methodological innovations for exploring it further. We conclude with some thoughts on how the study of culture and its integration through reflexive, locally grounded approaches, while challenging, provides new opportunities for the development of LSS.";2021;"land, culture, system, models, influence"

Aside from their stated concerns and demands, however, very little is known about why young people have been joining this growing movement. Using a large sample (N = 4057) of people in Switzerland aged between 14 and 25, we show that social identity is most strongly associated with participation, followed by beliefs about the effectiveness of youth strikes, level of education, and worry about climate change. Our findings affirm the relevance of both climate change risk perceptions and social identity-related processes for collective climate change action, and pave the way for promising opportunities in theory development and integration. The study also provides lessons for those who seek to maintain and increase collective action on climate change: concern about climate change is an important motivating factor, but social identity processes are at least as relevant for young people?s participation.";2020;"climate, youth, identity, education, action"

Water accounting frameworks are useful tools for reporting on water resources availability and uses. Here, we combine the Water Accounting Plus (WA+) framework with hydrological modelling and climate change scenarios to quantify current and future conditions of water resources in the Volta River basin located in West Africa. Hydrological processes derived from the fully distributed mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) are fed into the WA+ framework to provide a comprehensive report on the current state and future trends of water resources. mHM is used to predict water fluxes, stocks and flows for the historical period 1999-2020 and the near future (2021-2050). Climate change projection datasets are obtained from a large ensemble of nine global climate models (GCMs) and four regional climate models (RCMs) under the emission scenario RCP8.5.  The WA+ report shows that the long-term net inflow in the basin over the period 1991-2020 is 389 km3/year and is projected to increase by 5% in the near future. However, only 8% of the net inflow is exploitable as ?blue water?, while the remainder is consumed as ?green water?, mainly in non-managed lands. The available water for various water uses in the basin amounts to 15 km3/year, of which 79% is utilized, while the remainder 21% is utilizable but not consumed. Only 42% of water use is beneficial for the intended purposes, with agriculture responsible for 35% of the beneficial water consumption. Future projections show an increase of 20% in the exploitable water fraction, while the available water fraction is expected to decrease by 5%. These findings show that climate change could disproportionally affect the exploitable and the available water, thereby calling for adaptation measures by the local authorities in the Volta River basin.";2020;"water, accounting, resources, climate, change"

This dataset provides global, 3-hourly estimates of the atmosphere from 1806 to 2015 by assimilating only surface pressure observations and prescribing sea surface temperature, sea ice concentration, and radiative forcings. Comparisons with independent observations, other reanalyses, and satellite products suggest that 20CRv3 can reliably produce atmospheric estimates on scales ranging from weather events to long-term climatic trends. Not only does 20CRv3 recreate a ?best estimate? of the weather, including extreme events, it also provides an estimate of its confidence through the use of an ensemble. Surface pressure statistics suggest that these confidence estimates are reliable. Comparisons with independent upper-air observations in the Northern Hemisphere demonstrate that 20CRv3 has skill throughout the 20th century. Upper-air fields from 20CRv3 in the late 20th century and early 21st century correlate well with full-input reanalyses, and the correlation is predicted by the confidence fields from 20CRv3. The skill of analyzed 500hPa geopotential heights from 20CRv3 for 1979-2015 is comparable to that of modern operational 3- to 4-day forecasts. Finally, 20CRv3 performs well on climate timescales. Long time series and multidecadal averages of mass, circulation, and precipitation fields agree well with modern reanalyses and station- and satellite-based products. 20CRv3 is also able to capture trends in tropospheric layer temperatures that correlate well with independent products in the 20th century, placing recent trends in a longer historical context.";2020;"reanalysis, atmosphere, global, confidence, trends"

Although much progress has been made in the development of LEMs, few have been tested in rivers subject to anthropogenic impacts that produce high energy flows, transporting large amounts of sediment and causing significant geomorphic changes. As such, it remains uncertain if LEMs are useful and stable under relatively short term ?extreme? geomorphic conditions. To shed light on this topic we use a LEM (CAESAR-Lisflood) and historical documents to develop a detailed reach scale model of the Kander river (Switzerland). This model was used to simulate the unintended impacts of engineering works, occurring in 1714, that deviated the Kander river into a lake and resulted in a large decrease in base level of the river. In 10 years, the model simulates knickpoint propagation that rapidly erodes 2.5 million m3 of sediment and produces a remarkable 27 m of channel erosion. Simultaneously, the model develops the formation of a delta via frequent avulsions. Model testing is performed by comparing model predictions against historical observations of channel incision, knickpoint location, and delta spatial extent. Overall, model error is low and the model remained stable as results do not contain erratic erosion or deposition. Importantly the model suggests that downstream processes occurring at and near the delta have an effect on upstream channel erosion. We also recommend that studies replicating historic landscape changes with LEMs reduce uncertainty in hydrological inputs.";2020;"landscape, evolution, models, testing, river"

Historical column ozone data are important not only for obtaining a long-term perspective of changes of the ozone layer but arguably also as diagnostics of lower-stratospheric or tropopause-level flow in time periods of sparse upper-air observations. With the exception of a few high-quality records such as that from Arosa, Switzerland, ozone science has almost exclusively focused on data since the International Geophysical Year (IGY) in 1957?1958, although earlier series exist. In the early 2000s, we digitised and re-evaluated many pre-IGY series. Here we add a series from Wellington, New Zealand, from 1951 to 1959. We re-evaluated the data from the original observation sheets and performed quality control analysis, and here we present the data. The day-to-day variability can be used to assess the quality of reanalysis products, since the data cover a region and time period with only few upper-air data. Comparison with total column ozone in the reanalyses ERA-PreSAT (which assimilates upper-air data) and 20CRv3 and CERA-20C (which do not assimilate upper-air data) shows high correlations with all three. Although trend quality is doubtful (no calibration information and no intercomparisons are available), combining the record with other available data (including historical data from Australian locations) allows a 70-year perspective of ozone changes over the southern mid-latitudes. The series will be available from the World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre. Finally, we also present a short series from Downham Market, UK, covering November 1950 to October 1951, and publish it with further historical data series that were previously described but not published.";2020;"ozone, historical, data, quality, records"

This work builds on our contribution to Phase 1 of the Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project (PlioMIP1) wherein we employed the same model without dynamic vegetation. Our input to the PlioMIP2 special issue of Climate of the Past is twofold. In an accompanying paper we compare results derived with COSMOS in the framework of PlioMIP2 and PlioMIP1. With this paper we present details of our contribution with COSMOS to PlioMIP2. We provide a description of the model and of methods employed to transfer reconstructed mid-Pliocene geography, as provided by the Pliocene Reconstruction and Synoptic Mapping Initiative Phase 4 (PRISM4), to model boundary conditions. We describe the spin-up procedure for creating the COSMOS PlioMIP2 simulation ensemble and present large-scale climate patterns of the COSMOS PlioMIP2 mid-Pliocene core simulation. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution of individual components of PRISM4 boundary conditions to characteristics of simulated mid-Pliocene climate and discuss implications for anthropogenic warming. When exposed to PRISM4 boundary conditions, COSMOS provides insight into a mid-Pliocene climate that is characterised by increased rainfall (+0.17-mm-d?1) and elevated surface temperature (+3.37-?C) in comparison to the pre-industrial (PI). About two-thirds of the mid-Pliocene core temperature anomaly can be directly attributed to carbon dioxide that is elevated with respect to PI. The contribution of topography and ice sheets to mid-Pliocene warmth is much smaller in contrast ? about one-quarter and one-eighth, respectively, and nonlinearities are negligible. The simulated mid-Pliocene climate comprises pronounced polar amplification, a reduced meridional temperature gradient, a northwards-shifted tropical rain belt, an Arctic Ocean that is nearly free of sea ice during boreal summer, and muted seasonality at Northern Hemisphere high latitudes. Simulated mid-Pliocene precipitation patterns are defined by both carbon dioxide and PRISM4 paleogeography. Our COSMOS simulations confirm long-standing characteristics of the mid-Pliocene Earth system, among these increased meridional volume transport in the Atlantic Ocean, an extended and intensified equatorial warm pool, and pronounced poleward expansion of vegetation cover. By means of a comparison of our results to a reconstruction of the sea surface temperature (SST) of the mid-Pliocene we find that COSMOS reproduces reconstructed SST best if exposed to a carbon dioxide concentration of 400-ppmv. In the Atlantic to Arctic Ocean the simulated mid-Pliocene core climate state is too cold in comparison to the SST reconstruction. The discord can be mitigated to some extent by increasing carbon dioxide that causes increased mismatch between the model and reconstruction in other regions.";2020;"alfred wegener institute, pliomip2, cosmos, mid-pliocene, climate"

However, available flood damage estimates are still characterized by significant levels of uncertainty, questioning the capacity of flood damage models to depict real damages. With a joint effort of eight international research groups, the objective of this study was to compare, in a blind-validation test, the performances of different models for the assessment of the direct flood damage to the residential sector at the building level (i.e. microscale). The test consisted of a common flood case study characterized by high availability of hazard and building data but with undisclosed information on observed losses in the implementation stage of the models. The nine selected models were chosen in order to guarantee a good mastery of the models by the research teams, variety of the modelling approaches, and heterogeneity of the original calibration context in relation to both hazard and vulnerability features. By avoiding possible biases in model implementation, this blind comparison provided more objective insights on the transferability of the models and on the reliability of their estimations, especially regarding the potentials of local and multivariable models. From another perspective, the exercise allowed us to increase awareness of strengths and limits of flood damage modelling, which are summarized in the paper in the form of take-home messages from a modeller's perspective.";2020;"flood, damage, models, test, residential"

The impacts of climate variability and change are generally stronger for disadvantaged population groups due to their limited adaptive and coping capacities. For instance, smallholder farmers living in remote areas such as the southern Peruvian Andes suffer strongly from adverse weather and climatic events such as droughts or frost. The project Climandes aimed at providing high-quality climate services in support of the agricultural sector in southern Peru by implementing the guidelines of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS). In Climandes, a two-fold challenge was tackled: the co-development of climate services by building up a continuous dialogue between the information provider (in this case the Peruvian national meteorological and hydrological service (NMHS)) and potential users; and the production of climate services through international cooperation. To this end, the NMHSs of Peru (SENAMHI) and Switzerland (MeteoSwiss) worked closely together to tackle issues ranging from the treatment of climate data to ensure the provision of reliable information to establishing continuous interaction with different user groups. In this paper, we postulate that this approach of close collaboration, the so-called twinning of the two NMHSs, was key for the projects? success and contributed to strengthening the Peruvian NMHS institutionally and procedurally.

It becomes increasingly important to understand how local governments can design effective flood risk management policies to address flood risks. In this article, we study whether high flood exposure and flood risk perception correlate with the demand for a specific design of flood risk management policies. We take the ideal case of Switzerland and analyze flood risk management portfolios in 18 flood-prone municipalities along the Aare River. We introduce a novel combination of risk analysis and public policy data: we analyze correlations between recorded flood exposure data and survey data on flood risk perception and policy preferences for selected flood risk management measures. Our results indicate that local governments with high flood risk perception tend to prefer non-structural measures, such as spatial planning and ecological river restoration, to infrastructure measures. In contrast, flood exposure is neither linked to flood risk perception nor to policy preferences. We conclude that flood risk perception is key: it can decisively affect local governments? preferences to implement specific diversified policy portfolios including more preventive or integrated flood risk management measures. These findings imply that local governments in flood-prone areas should invest in raising their population?s awareness capacity of flood risks and keep it high during periods without flooding.";2020;"flood, risk, perception, management, policy"

In the housing sector, however, tempo-rary uses are barely registered as they provide only short-term shelter in buildings shortly be-fore demolition. Therefore, they do not secure a stable right to housing. In Switzerland, never-theless, temporary uses are increasingly gaining momentum in the housing segment. Since the 2010s, besides institutionalised but non-profit temporary housing, a for-profit model has emerged. This commodified model is managed on the owners? behalf and is based on loaning law contracts that require payment for operating costs, but not rent. Consequently, the legal pro-tection of the temporary users? rights, namely low-income families, single parents, people with social aid, and students remains weak. This article detects the mechanisms at play explaining the reasons for the shift towards profit-seeking in temporary housing by using an institutionalist and actor-centred analysis approach.

"879";"Negotiating social differences and power geometries among healthcare professionals in a Swiss hospital";"Carole Ammann and Julia Mall and Marina Richter and Susan Thieme";"In this article, we analyse two parallel processes taking place in the Swiss healthcare sector, namely differentiation and standardisation: On one hand, the health sector is increasingly characterised by differentiation that originates from the specialisation of training, the differentiation and academisation of nursing, the feminisation of medicine, the migration of healthcare personnel, and the entry of men into nursing professions. In addition, a new generation joining the health sector labour force is challenging taken-for-granted notions about health professions. On the other hand, healthcare organisations such as hospitals need to ensure they are functioning well by increasingly relying on standardisation processes such as checklists, standardised protocols, or ethical guidelines. For this paper, we have conducted an institutional ethnography of a Swiss acute hospital by employing an intersectional analysis. Based on interviews and shadowing, we argue that the social differences between and among nurses and physicians are constantly negotiated every day. We demonstrate that those differences lead to power imbalances along the intersectional axes of age, gender, place of education, and professional position. Our findings have implications for general debates in health-related fields; for management and organizational studies more in general; and in particular for feminist labour geographies, as they place debates on work-relations, power, hierarchy, and intersectional social differences into a specific organizational and spatial context.";2020;"differentiation, standardisation, swiss, healthcare, intersectional"

Here we show that color and grain size are essential parameters characterizing loess profiles and support robust stratigraphies as a basis for reconstructions in the context of local geo-ecological and large-scale paleoclimatic evolution. Detailed paleoenvironmental records from the period since the arrival of anatomically modern humans to the last glacial maximum are scarce in the Alpine surroundings. The c. 7.5 m thick LPS Krems-Wachtberg, NE Austria, known for its well-preserved Upper Paleolithic context at a depth of 5.5 m, formed between 40 and 20 ka BP by quasi-continuous dust-sedimentation, interrupted by phases of incipient pedogenesis and local reworking. The new KW2015 composite is based on three sections studied and sampled at 2.5 cm resolution. Color and grain size data support a robust stratigraphy for reconstructions of the pedosedimentary evolution. The marked transition from oxidized to reduced paleosols of KW2015 around 34?35 ka corresponds to the Middle-to Upper Pleniglacial transition as part of a general cooling trend from marine isotope stage (MIS) 3 to 2, intensely modulated by millennial-scale climatic fluctuations as recorded in the Greenland ice core data. The distinct response of KW2015 to these trends highlights that reconstructing LPS evolution based on a robust stratigraphy is a prerequisite to paleoenvironmental proxy interpretation.";2020;"dust, sedimentation, pedogenesis, erosion, color"

Kennedy and Timothy Hugh Raupach";"The lower-order moments of the drop size distribution (DSD) have generally been considered difficult to retrieve accurately from polarimetric radar data because these data are related to higher-order moments. For example, the 4.6th moment is associated with a specific differential phase and the 6th moment with reflectivity and ratio of high-order moments with differential reflectivity. Thus, conventionally, the emphasis has been to estimate rain rate (3.67th moment) or parameters of the exponential or gamma distribution for the DSD. Many double-moment ?bulk? microphysical schemes predict the total number concentration (the 0th moment of the DSD, or M0) and the mixing ratio (or equivalently, the 3rd moment M3). Thus, it is difficult to compare the model outputs directly with polarimetric radar observations or, given the model outputs, forward model the radar observables. This article describes the use of double-moment normalization of DSDs and the resulting stable intrinsic shape that can be fitted by the generalized gamma (G-G) distribution. The two reference moments are M3 and M6, which are shown to be retrievable using the X-band radar reflectivity, differential reflectivity, and specific attenuation (from the iterative correction of measured reflectivity Zh using the total {ensuremath{Phi";2020;"moments, moments, distributions, radar, retrieval"

We analyzeanalyzed the patterns and determinants of agricultural land abandonment and recultivation in Slovakia during the transition from a state-controlled economy to an open-market economy (1986 to 2000) and the subsequent accession to the European Union (2000 to 2010). We quantified agricultural land-use change based on available maps derived from 30-m multi-seasonal Landsat imagery and analyzeanalyzed the socioeconomic and biophysical determinants of the observed agricultural land-use changes using boosted regression trees. We used a scenario-based approach to assess future agricultural land abandonment and recultivation until 2060. The maps of agricultural land use analysis reveal that cropland abandonment was the dominant land use process on 11% of agricultural land from 1986 to 2000, and on 6% of the agricultural land from 2000 to 2010. Recultivation occurred on approximately 2% of agricultural land in both periods. Although most abandoned land was located in the plains, the rate of abandonment was twice as high in the mountainous landscapes. The likelihood of abandonment increased with increased distance from the national capital (Bratislava), decreased with an increase of annual mean temperatures and was higher in proximity to forest edges and on steeper slopes. Recultivation was largely determined by the opposite effects. The scenario for 2060 suggests that future agricultural land abandonment and recultivation may largely be determined by climate and terrain conditions and, to a lesser extent, by proximity to economic centers. Our study underscores the value of synergetic use of satellite data and land-use modeling to provide the input for land planning, and to anticipate the potential effects of changing environmental and policy conditions.";2020;"land use, agricultural, abandonment, recultivation, slovakia"
"892";"Early Warning from Space for a Few Key Tipping Points in Physical, Biological, and Social-Ecological Systems";"Didier Swingedouw and Chinwe Ifejika Speranza and Annett Bartsch and Gael Durand and Cedric Jamet and Gregory Beaugrand and Alessandra Conversi";"In this review paper, we explore latest results concerning a few key tipping elements of the Earth system in the ocean, cryosphere, and land realms, namely the Atlantic overturning circulation and the subpolar gyre system, the marine ecosystems, the permafrost, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and in terrestrial resource use systems. All these different tipping elements share common characteristics related to their nonlinear nature. They can also interact with each other leading to synergies that can lead to cascading tipping points. Even if the probability of each tipping event is low, they can happen relatively rapidly, involve multiple variables, and have large societal impacts. Therefore, adaptation measures and management in general should extend their focus beyond slow and continuous changes, into abrupt, nonlinear, possibly cascading, high impact phenomena. Remote sensing observations are found to be decisive in the understanding and determination of early warning signals of many tipping elements. Nevertheless, considerable research still remains to properly incorporate these data in the current generation of coupled Earth system models. This is a key prerequisite to correctly develop robust decadal prediction systems that may help to assess the risk of crossing thresholds potentially crucial for society. The prediction of tipping points remains difficult, notably due to stochastic resonance, i.e. the interaction between natural variability and anthropogenic forcing, asking for large ensembles of predictions to correctly assess the risks. Furthermore, evaluating the proximity to crucial thresholds using process-based understanding of each system remains a key aspect to be developed for an improved assessment of such risks. This paper finally proposes a few research avenues concerning the use of remote sensing data and the need for combining different sources of data, and having long and precise-enough time series of the key variables needed to monitor Earth system tipping elements.";2020;"tipping, remote, nonlinear, prediction, risk"

The datasets consist of satellite-based diagnostic models (MOD16A2, SSEBop, ALEXI, CMRSET, SEBS), satellite-based prognostic models (GLEAM v3.2a, GLEAM v3.3a, GLEAM v3.2b, GLEAM v3.3b), and reanalysis (ERA5, MERRA-2, JRA-55). Four distinct multivariate calibration strategies (basin-average, pixel-wise, spatial bias-accounting and spatial bias-insensitive) using actual evaporation and streamflow are implemented, resulting in 48 scenarios whose results are compared with a benchmark model calibrated solely with streamflow data. A process-diagnostic approach is adopted to evaluate the model responses with in-situ data of streamflow and independent remotely sensed data of soil moisture from ESA-CCI and terrestrial water storage from GRACE. The method is implemented in the Volta River basin, which is a data scarce region in West Africa, for the period from 2003 to 2012. Results show that the evaporation datasets have a good potential for improving model calibration, but this is dependent on the calibration strategy. All the multivariate calibration strategies outperform the streamflow-only calibration. The highest improvement in the overall model performance is obtained with the spatial bias-accounting strategy (+29%), followed by the spatial bias-insensitive strategy (+26%) and the pixel-wise strategy (+24%), while the basin-average strategy (+20%) gives the lowest improvement. On average, using evaporation data in addition to streamflow for model calibration decreases the model performance for streamflow (-7%), which is counterbalance by the increase in the performance of the terrestrial water storage (+11%), temporal dynamics of soil moisture (+6%) and spatial patterns of soil moisture (+89%). In general, the top three best performing evaporation datasets are MERRA-2, GLEAM v3.3a and SSEBop, while the bottom three datasets are MOD16A2, SEBS and ERA5. However, performances of the evaporation products diverge according to model responses and across climatic zones. These findings open up avenues for improving process representation of hydrological models and advancing the spatiotemporal prediction of floods and droughts under climate and land use changes.";2020;"evaporation, model, calibration, performance, improvement"

Mudstone-derived high clay contents result in a unique set of sedimentary and pedogenic properties of these archives in that all units exhibit vertic properties. Since the horizons have a polygenic history, detailed field and micromorphological observations, together with laboratory analyses (grain-size, color, iron-pedochemistry) are the basis for a classification of the pedosediments. 14C dating provides a chronological framework for geomorphological stability phases and thus, identified soil-forming processes. The first anthropogenic colluvial sediments of the studied archive date to the Early Bronze Age and accumulated in an initial karst depression. Water saturation caused iron reduction of these early infillings. In the pedosediments above, oxidation and iron release are largely related to changes in the parent material. Here, the soil material contains coarse silt indicating an admixture of nearby periglacial slope deposits. Furthermore, fossil root traces point to a longer time with stable conditions, which we interpret as absence of humans or at least an extended period of fallow land. The superimposed sediments from the Urnfield period are more inhomogeneous and consist of material from the eroded agricultural soils of the surrounding. The characteristics of these pedosediments point to intensified human land use. Pedogenic processes such as iron release, reduction of iron, swelling-shrinking, and short-distance translocation of clay intensively overprinted all soil sediments. In this context, micromorphology proved to be an essential tool for the characterization of polygenesis in terms of soil-forming as well as redepositional processes that lead to the formation of these complex archives. The present study reflects a multi-methodological approach to a rather disregarded type of polygenic terrestrial records. It constitutes an example for the investigation of clayey pedosediments in karstic environments under moderate climate in the frame of a prehistoric geoarcheological setting.";2020;"sinkholes, gypsum, pedosedimentary, interaction, human"

Schroeer and H{'e";"Nowcasting of hailstorms still poses a major challenge to weather services, because of the limited availability of reliable large datasets and the short spatio?temporal scales involved. Two novel Eulerian and Lagrangian hail climatologies for the Alps are applied to address important aspects of hailstorms in the Alps: the diurnal cycle, their spatio?temporal development and the lightning properties. The database contains more than 100,000 ordinary and 30,000 hail storms (2002?2017). Based on that large sample of storms, the diurnal cycle of storm initiation and evolution is studied in the context of orographic forcing and cold?front occurrence statistics. Results show that, during daytime, storms mainly initiate over the foothills (Prealps) and move towards areas with higher terrain elevations. During night?time, the storms preferably move from the foothills to the plains. Five out of 16-years of the radar?derived convective storms show a significant yearly positive hail anomaly, from which two-years show relative hail?initiation maxima evenly distributed over the 24-hour without a characteristic diurnal cycle. Relative hail maxima during night?time cannot always be explained with a higher occurrence of cold fronts. Time series of storm vertically integrated liquid water content are used to separate ordinary and hail storm development. Differences are found between vertically integrated liquid and its density in cold air?mass storms. Finally, lightning data from a ground?based network are combined with the radar?derived hailstreaks and evaluated with respect to their prediction skill as a function of lead time (flash rate, density, peak current, lightning jumps). Results show that lightning data provide only modest skill?scores in nowcasting hailstorms. Only the sudden increase in lightning rate (referred to as lightning jump) may be used as additional data for hailstorm nowcasting. However, their application in automatic nowcasting systems remains challenging as the lightning jumps occurs at various lead times in the series.";2020;"nowcasting, hailstorms, alps, diurnal, lightning"
"901";"Strategic use of land policy instruments for affordable housing ? Coping with social challenges under scarce land conditions in Swiss cities";"Gabriela Debrunner and Thomas Hartmann";"For decades, many cities have introduced densification policy objectives to stop urban sprawl or to promote efficient use of natural resources. In the urban housing sector, however, densification projects often intensify social challenges. Due to rising rents after modernization of existing housing stocks as a consequence of den- sification, low-income tenants are forced to leave their apartments. Risks of social exclusion and segregation increase simultaneously. In this article, we analyze how municipal planning authorities cope with affordable housing shortages in a context of urban densification. Specifically, we ask: How do municipal planning authorities promote affordable housing in densifying cities? To answer this research question, we apply a neoinstitutional analysis approach to better understand (1) the basic mechanisms of how land policy instruments impact affordability, and (2) why specific instruments are activated to defend affordable housing objectives. Through qualitative case study analysis of four Swiss urban municipalities, our results show that the mere availability of land policy instruments is not sufficient but that the strategic activation of specific instruments matters.";2020;"densification, social challenges, affordable housing, municipal planning authorities, land policy instruments"

As members of the Task Force Rural Africa (TFRA), we produced a report in March 2019 on what we thought was needed to transform Africa?s agriculture and rural economy. Less than one year later, COVID-19 struck Africa and the rest of the world with devastating effect. Another important change since March 2019 has been the shift on climate policy, represented by the EU Commission proposal in December 2019 of the European Green Deal (EGD). This ambitious vision, aimed at making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050, will have implications for Africa ? Europe relations. The combination of COVID-19?s impact on Africa and the EU?s climate policy change has led us to re-examine the analysis and the recommendations in our original report. We have drawn one central conclusion from our work: that food and nutrition security has become of such fundamental political, economic and social importance that it must be at the centre of all future policy and planning. We have built our report on this conclusion and produced a set of short and long-term recommendations we believe are relevant to the new world shaped by the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope our contribution may help in the preparation of the AU-EU Summit in October 2020. The Summit will seek to agree the long-term basis for partnership between Africa and the EU. It will meet at a crucially important time, shortly before the US Presidential election, when the world will be looking to see how Africa and Europe, separately and in partnership, can contribute to an effective multilateral response to global challenges and the current COVID-19 crisis.

"904";"A generic physical vulnerability model for floods: review and concept for data-scarce regions";"Mark Bawa Malgwi and Sven Fuchs and Margreth Keiler";"The use of different methods for physical flood vulnerability assessment has evolved over time, from traditional single-parameter stage?damage curves to multi-parameter approaches such as multivariate or indicator-based models. However, despite the extensive implementation of these models in flood risk assessment globally, a considerable gap remains in their applicability to data-scarce regions. Considering that these regions are mostly areas with a limited capacity to cope with disasters, there is an essential need for assessing the physical vulnerability of the built environment and contributing to an improvement of flood risk reduction. To close this gap, we propose linking approaches with reduced data requirements, such as vulnerability indicators (integrating major damage drivers) and damage grades (integrating frequently observed damage patterns). First, we present a review of current studies of physical vulnerability indicators and flood damage models comprised of stage?damage curves and the multivariate methods that have been applied to predict damage grades. Second, we propose a new conceptual framework for assessing the physical vulnerability of buildings exposed to flood hazards that has been specifically tailored for use in data-scarce regions. This framework is operationalized in three steps: (i) developing a vulnerability index, (ii) identifying regional damage grades, and (iii) linking resulting index classes with damage patterns, utilizing a synthetic ?what-if? analysis. The new framework is a first step for enhancing flood damage prediction to support risk reduction in data-scarce regions. It addresses selected gaps in the literature by extending the application of the vulnerability index for damage grade prediction through the use of a synthetic multi-parameter approach. The framework can be adapted to different data-scarce regions and allows for integrating possible modifications to damage drivers and damage grades.";2020;"evolution, vulnerability, assessment, indicators, regions"

In this study, we investigated how these parameters depend on elevation by one-year temperature measurements along a transect in the Valais Alps (Switzerland) between 700 and 2,600 m a.s.l. In addition, we studied the effect of differences in slope aspect (north/south) and land cover (open field/forest). Air temperatures were measured as a reference. The results show that the ground thermal regime distinctly differs from that of the air. These differences could mainly be attributed to radiation, snow cover, and ground heat transfer. Our findings have far-reaching implications for ecosystems, agriculture, and forestry in mountains because a large portion of the living biomass is underground and thus affected by ground thermal processes.";2020;"temperature, elevation, alps, thermal, ground"

RF agriculture is conducted today in the Congo Basin, offering an instructive analogue to pre-Columbian RFs in Amazonia. Our study of construction of present-day RFs documents periodic addition of organic matter (OM) during repeated field/fallow cycles. Field investigations of RF profiles supported by spectrophotometry reveal a characteristic stratigraphy. Soil geochemistry indicates that the management of Congo RFs improves soil fertility for a limited time when they are under cultivation, but nutrient availability in fallow RFs differs little from that in uncultivated reference topsoils. Furthermore, examination of soil micromorphology shows that within less than 40 years, bioturbation almost completely removes stratigraphic evidence of repeated OM amendments. If Amazonian RFs were similarly managed, their vestiges would thus be unlikely to show traces of such management centuries after abandonment. These results call into question the hypothesis that the sole purpose of constructing RFs in pre-Columbian Amazonia was drainage.";2020;"rf ,agriculture, soil, fertility, amazonia"

These assumptions must be reconsidered with adequate theoretical perspectives and with the empirical experience of recent studies. This paper introduces the concept of channels of labour control in agriculture based on four initiatives in Senegalese agroecological horticulture. We build on Bourdieu's theory of social fields to elaborate a framework that articulates multiple channels of labour control with the type of capital or surplus values structuring power relations during labour processes. Although each of the four agroecological initiatives place a clear emphasis on improving farmers' well-being, various top-down channels of labour control exist, maintaining most farmworkers as technical demonstrators rather than agents of transformation. These constraints stem from dependence on foreign funding, enforcement of uncoordinated organic standards, and farmers' incorporation of cultural values through interplays of knowledge and symbolic power with initiative promotors. Pressure on agricultural workers is exacerbated by the context of the neo-liberalisation of Senegalese agriculture and increasingly difficult climatic conditions. A more holistic approach of agroecological initiatives is needed, including the institutionalisation of protected markets for their products, farmers' inclusion in agroecosystem governance and inclusiveness in the co-production of agroecological knowledge, taking cultural patterns of local communities into account. Recent attempts to scale-up and politicise agroecology through farmers' organisations, advocacy NGOs, and municipalities may offer new perspectives for a just agroecological transition in sub-Saharan Africa.";2020;"agroecological, labour, control, power, farmers"

Here, we have used observations from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean(SHEBA) project to compile Eulerian observations along the trajectories of warm and cold air masses in a Lagrangian sense, showing the cooling and drying of air masses over sea ice and moistening over the open ocean.

While many studies compare methods, we will focus in this study on the consequences of the input data choice in a state-of-the-art Kalman-filter paleoclimate data assimilation approach. We evaluate reconstruction quality in the 20th century based on three collections of tree-ring records: (1) 54 of the best temperature-sensitive tree-ring chronologies chosen by experts; (2) 415 temperature-sensitive tree-ring records chosen less strictly by regional working groups and statistical screening; (3) 2287 tree-ring series that are not screened for climate sensitivity. The three data sets cover the range from small sample size, small spatial coverage and strict screening for temperature sensitivity to large sample size and spatial coverage but no screening. Additionally, we explore a combination of these data sets plus screening methods to improve the reconstruction quality.  A large, unscreened collection generally leads to a poor reconstruction skill. A small expert selection of extratropical Northern Hemisphere records allows for a skillful high-latitude temperature reconstruction but cannot be expected to provide information for other regions and other variables.

This leads to the question of the extent to which diabatic heating associated with heavy precipitation events influences Northern Hemisphere blocking. This study uses 5-years of 3?day back trajectories started from objectively identified blocks in the ERA?Interim dataset to investigate this relationship. A substantial fraction of air parcels in blocks pass through heavy precipitation areas. The exact fraction depends on the choice of heavy precipitation threshold. Roughly 19% of all the trajectories in a block pass a heavy precipitation area ({ensuremath{>";2020;"atmospheric, blocking, diabatic, heavy, precipitation"

Rayner and Renate Auchmann and Janette Bessembinder and Stefan Br{\"o";"Day-to-day variations in surface air temperature affect society in many ways, but daily surface air temperature measurements are not available everywhere. Therefore, a global daily picture cannot be achieved with measurements made in situ alone and needs to incorporate estimates from satellite retrievals.  This article presents the science developed in the EU Horizon 2020-funded EUSTACE project (2015-2019, https://www.eustaceproject.org) to produce global and European, multi-decadal ensembles of daily analyses of surface air temperature complementary to those from dynamical reanalyses, integrating different ground-based and satellite-borne data types. Relationships between surface air temperature measurements and satellite-based estimates of surface skin temperature over all surfaces of Earth (land, ocean, ice and lakes) are quantified. Information contained in the satellite retrievals then helps to estimate air temperature and create global fields in the past, using statistical models of how surface air temperature varies in a connected way from place to place; this needs efficient statistical analysis methods to cope with the considerable data volumes. Daily fields are presented as ensembles to enable propagation of uncertainties through applications. Estimated temperatures and their uncertainties are evaluated against independent measurements and other surface temperature data sets.  Achievements in the EUSTACE project have also included fundamental preparatory work useful to others, for example: gathering user requirements; identifying inhomogeneities in daily surface air temperature measurement series from weather stations; carefully quantifying uncertainties in satellite skin and air temperature estimates; exploring the interaction between air temperature and lakes; developing statistical models relevant to non-Gaussian variables; and methods for efficient computation.";2020;"temperature, society, satellite, global, analysis"

De Bruijn and Neelke Doorn and Frans Klijn";"Flood risk management decisions in many countries are based on decision-support frameworks which rely on cost-bene?t analyses. Such frameworks are seldom informative about the geographical distribution of risk, raising questions on the fairness of the proposed policies. In the present work, we propose a new decision criterion that accounts for the distribution of risk reduction and apply it to support ?ood risk management decisions on a transboundary stretch of the Rhine River. Three types of interventions are considered:embankment heightening, making Room for the River, and changing the discharge distribution of the river branches. The analysis involves solving a ?ood risk management problem according to four alternative formulations, based on different ethical principles. Formulations based on cost optimization lead to very poor performances in some areas for the sake of reducing the overall aggregated costs. Formulations that also include equity criteria have different results depending on how these are de?ned. When risk reduction is distributed equally, very poor economic performance is achieved. When risk is distributed equally, results are inline with formulations based on cost optimization, while a fairer risk distribution is achieved.Risk reduction measures also differ, with the cost optimization approach strongly favoring the leverage of changing the discharge distribution and the alternative formulations spending more on embankment heightening and Room for the River, to rebalance inequalities in risk levels. The proposed method advances risk-based decision-making by allowing to consider risk distribution aspects and their impacts on the choice of risk reduction measures.";2020;"flood, risk, management, distribution, decision-making"

The current water management challenges are inherently unpredictable and difficult to control. Social-ecological systems (SESs) approaches explicitly recognize the connections and feedbacks between human and natural systems. For addressing the complex challenges of the Anthropocene, consideration of SES attributes such as causality (or interdependence), feedback, non-linearity, heterogeneity, and cross-scale dynamics is important. In addition, innovative qualitative and quantitative methods such as Bayesian networks, agent-based modelling, system dynamics, network analysis, multicriteria analysis, integrated assessment and role-play games have recently been used in SES research. The overall goal of this review is to gauge the extent to which SES attributes and methods are considered within the current interdisciplinary water paradigm. The paper therefore develops the normative theoretical characteristics of SES in terms of its key attributes (i.e. causality, feedback, heterogeneity, nonlinearity, and cross-scale dynamics) incorporated in the water paradigm approaches. The paper then compares the methods applied in the interdisciplinary water paradigm and examines how they can complement each other. Finally, the paper reflects back on the usefulness of SES attributes and methods for assessing the interdisciplinary water paradigm and makes recommendations for future research.";2020;"anthropocene, social-ecological systems, attributes, methods, interdisciplinary"

We have developed a new rapid and low-cost approach to infer the concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and related chlorophyll derivatives (pheopigmentsa) from the mathematical decomposition of UV?VIS measured bulk spectrophotometer absorption spectra of standard solutions and sediment extracts. We validated our method against high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements on standard solutions and on varved, anoxic sediment from eutrophic  Lake Lugano (Ponte Tresa sub-basin, southern Switzerland), where the history of productivity is relatively well known for the twentieth century. Our mathematical approach quantifies the concentration of chlorophyll b (R2adJ= 0.99,RMSEP*5.9%),  chlorophyll a (R2adJ= 0.98,RMSEP*5.0%), and pyropheophorbide a (R2adJ= 0.99, RMSEP*7.8%) in standard solutions.

Therefore, this study collected published emission data from stored cattle and pig slurry to determine baseline emission values and emission changes due to slurry treatment and coverage of stores. Emission data were collected from 120 papers yielding 711 records of measurements conducted at farm-, pilot- and laboratory-scale. The emission data reported in a multitude of units were standardized and compiled in a database. Descriptive statistics of the data from untreated slurry stored uncovered revealed a large variability in emissions for all gases. To determine baseline emissions, average values based on a weighting of the emission data according to the season and the duration of the emission measurements were constructed using the data from farm-scale and pilot-scale studies. Baseline emissions for cattle and pig slurry stored uncovered were calculated. When possible, it was further distinguished between storage in tanks without slurry treatment and storage in lagoons which implies solid-liquid separation and biological treatment. The baseline emissions on an area or volume basis are: for NH3: 0.12 g m?2 h-1 and 0.15 g m?2 h-1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in lagoons, and 0.08 g m?2 h-1 and 0.24 g m?2 h-1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in tanks; for N2O: 0.0003 g m?2 h-1 for cattle slurry stored in lagoons, and 0.002 g m?2 h-1 for both slurry types stored in tanks; for CH4: 0.95 g m-3 h-1 and 3.5 g m-3 h-1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in lagoons, and 0.58 g m-3 h-1 and 0.68 g m-3 h-1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in tanks; for CO2: 6.6 g m?2 h-1 and 0.3 g m?2 h-1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in lagoons, and 8.0 g m?2 h-1 for both slurry types stored in tanks; for H2S: 0.04 g m?2 h-1 and 0.01 g m?2 h-1 for cattle and pig slurry stored in lagoons. Related to total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), baseline emissions for tanks are 16% and 15% of TAN for cattle and pig slurry, respectively. Emissions of N2O and CH4 relative to nitrogen (N) and volatile solids (VS) are 0.13% of N and 0.10% of N and 2.9% of VS and 4.7% of VS for cattle and pig slurry, respectively. Total greenhouse gas emissions from slurry stores are dominated by CH4. The records on slurry treatment using acidification show a reduction of NH3 and CH4 emissions during storage while an increase occurs for N2O and a minor change for CO2 as compared to untreated slurry. Solid-liquid separation causes higher losses for NH3 and a reduction in CH4, N2O and CO2 emissions. Anaerobically digested slurry shows higher emissions during storage for NH3 while losses tend to be lower for CH4 and little changes occur for N2O and CO2 compared to untreated slurry. All cover types are found to be efficient for emission mitigation of NH3 from stores. The N2O emissions increase in many cases due to coverage. Lower CH4 emissions occur for impermeable covers as compared to uncovered slurry storage while for permeable covers the effect is unclear or emissions tend to increase. Limited and inconsistent data regarding emission changes with covering stores are available for CO2 and H2S. The compiled data provide a basis for improving emission inventories and highlight the need for further research to reduce uncertainty and fill data gaps regarding emissions from slurry storage.";2020;"storage, slurry, emissions, livestock, treatment"

Blockchain technology is a peer-to-peer protocol that can be leveraged to keep track of transactions over the internet. Publicised for its use in the bitcoin revolution, the technology provides transparency and traceability that can be used in the management of land rights. When it comes to the formalisation of land rights, blockchain technology promises to authenticate owners and other users of land, and provides a fixed ledger of land use rights transactions. At present, blockchain technology is being explored as a proof of concept in several countries to track land titles (state to individual). We extend the idea to capture the granting of land use rights (individual to individual) making use of the decentralisation, peer-to-peer nature of blockchain technology. While the technology is not a panacea to all land administration challenges, it can offer an effective means to manage land transactions, provide digital documentation to actors in the informal land rental market and reduce inefficiency in land systems. However, the uptake of the technology in land administration is limited by human related factors. These limitations include, but are not limited to, the accuracy of data being entered into the system, the ability of the system to facilitate data preservation, pre-existing institutional and legal pillars, and the digital divide across communities. Part of overcoming these barriers requires the political will of governments to invest in digital technologies and develop institutional capacities to overcome current limitations to bring land management into the industry 4.0 era.";2020;"blockchain, land rights, documentation, transactions, technology"

Such concept simultaneously considers the place as a living, social being with agency and as the target of ritual offerings, and as a spatial container of ecological knowledge, and individual and collective memory. This apparently dual conceptualization and practical use challenges the division of the profane and the sacred, the common and the proper and the living and the non-living and has profound implications for thinking and building sustainability from a transdisciplinary perspective. It nevertheless also represents an opportunity to re-think ecosystems from a physically and ontically open perspective.

This study addresses aspects of power and social justice related to the social-ecological system of the Niayes coastal region of Senegal and examines the potential of agroecology to improve the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. We performed a knowledge co-production process with a local farmer union to identify the main social-ecological nexuses that matter for smallholder farmers, their dynamics and the influence of powerful actors and institutions on them. We also look at the potential actions of the farmer union under the banner of agroecology to transform these dynamics. We found that social-ecological dynamics involve reinforcing feedback loops that undermine the resilience of smallholder farmers and that powerful actors such as agribusinesses have a strong influence on these processes. Union actions promoting agroecology have enhanced system thinking and related solutions, but observed social justice claims are very recent and have a limited scope. Our findings expand the notion of resilience grabbing, understood as the undermining of resilience through the loss of commons, to include systemic degradations due to direct and indirect actions of involved stakeholders. We also propose to expand the notion of resilience justice vertically, integrating procedural and recognition justice, and horizontally, integrating linked social-ecological issues. We conclude that agroecology can become a transformative bridge from resilience grabbing to resilience justice, but must be more sensitive to power relations, in particular around labour.";2020;"semi-arid, social-ecological, agroecology, smallholder farmers, resilience"

Accordingly, a sample of environmental DNA (eDNA) from streamflow at the outlet of a catchment can be used as an indicator of the upstream biodiversity. eDNA?s use in ecological studies is becoming more and more common and it seems reasonable to assume that eDNA might also offer a powerful tool as a hydrologic tracer. However, the original ecological proposition largely simplifies the complexity of any seasonal, diurnal, or spatial variation according to hydrologic flow paths and processes. From a hydrological perspective, this shortcoming is particularly problematic in Alpine headwater catchments, where the combination of snowmelt-dominated summer flow and particularly high climatic and geomorphologic heterogeneity results in hydrologic flow paths that are especially dynamic in space and time.   We were interested to see if on one hand, eDNA could teach us something new about hydrologic (subsurface) flow paths, and on the other hand, if biodiversity assessment should consider hydrologic variation in detail. To do so, we sampled natural occurring eDNA at 11 points distributed over the 13.4 km2, intensively monitored Vallon de Nant (1189-3051 m. a.s.l., Switzerland) between March and September 2017. We chose points corresponding to three different potential microhabitats and flow regimes (main channel, tributary, and spring) likely both inhabited by characteristic organismal communities and of interest for identifying hydrologic flow paths. We found that at moments when streamflow was increasing rapidly, biological richness in upstream points in the main channel and in tributaries was highest contrary to springs, where richness was higher when electrical conductivity was highest.  Thus, the main conclusion from our work is that elevated richness corresponds to moments in time when multiple mechanisms transport additional, probably terrestrial, DNA into water storage or flow compartments. These mechanisms could include overbank flow, stream network expansion, and hyporheic exchange. Our data demonstrates that biodiversity assessments using eDNA do need to consider hydrologic processes and shows that there is a potential future for eDNA among hydrologic tracers.  We will give recommendations in this talk about how to sample eDNA to answer hydrologic questions.";2020;"stream networks, genetic material, biodiversity, hydrologic tracer, ecological studies"

Little isknown about Holocene anoxia and meromixis events when anthropogenic impacts were weaker andnatural ecosystem variability played the dominant role. In this study, we examine the relationship be-tween lake mixing and lake production, climate variability, vegetation cover, catchment erosion and (pre)historic anthropogenic impacts in Moossee (Switzerland), over the last 15,000 years.

Extreme discharge variations between summer and winter, negative temperatures and intense sediment transport are the main issues for sensors (that get easily clogged, frozen or stucked out of the water) as well as for cross-section stability (a pre-condition for using a rating curve approach).  In this presentation, we discuss what we learned from streamflow observations in the experimental Vallon de Nant catchment (13,4 km?), located in the Swiss Alps, which serves as a field laboratory for environmental research, ranging from plant ecology to snow hydrology and sediment transport to stream-C02 exchange with the atmosphere. We discuss here 4 years of optical height gauge records at the outlet (1200 m a.s.l.), obtained from a single VEGA-PULS WL-61 sensor measuring the water height above a concrete trapezoidal shaped cross-section (base width 5.3 m), designed primarily for sediment transport observations (with 10 geophones mounted flush on the concrete weir). There was no low flow channel within the cross-section. At least four other similar gauging stations are currently in use for hydrologic research in Switzerland, with or without low flow channels. The relevance of a discharge quality study at this site is twofold: i) to understand the reliability of flow measurements during low flow and during sediment-influenced high flow events and ii) to compile recommendations for similar discharge observation settings.   At the Vallon de Nant study site, the absence of a low-flow channel in the weir, combined with the limitation of having a single river stage measuring point resulted in significant over- and under-estimation of the river stage at low-flows, caused by the fluctuation of the river bed position relative to that of the measuring point. Even if the flow covers the entire width of the weir crest, single clast deposits near to the crest can significantly disturb stage observations. We performed a validation of the data using hourly pictures taken during daytime with a low-cost camera at the outlet, and used the photographic evidence to identify periods when the river was partially or totally frozen, sediments were distorting the river stage measurements, and river channelization was occurring below or next to the river height sensor. Concurrent monitoring of temperature, conductivity or turbidity failed to identify these distortions. Consequently, significant error in discharge calculation would arise without a concurrent photographic observation. The key conclusion is that despite the growth of automation in measurements at gauging stations, there remains a need for observation of those stations, and if humans are no longer doing these, other digital technologies such as imaging need to be used instead. Our approach could be extended to night-time situations and locations that will go for extremely long periods without access.";2020;"discharge, measurement, mountain, sensors, validation"

For Switzerland, daily resolved spatial information on meteorological parameters is restricted to the period starting from 1961, whereas prior to that local station observations are the only source of daily long-term weather data. While attempts have been made to reconstruct spatial weather patterns for certain extreme events, the task of creating a continuous spatial weather reconstruction dataset for Switzerland has so far not been addressed. Here, we aim to reconstruct daily high-resolution precipitation and temperature fields for Switzerland back to 1864 with an analogue resampling method (ARM) using station data and a weather type classification. Analogue reconstructions are post-processed with an ensemble Kalman fitting (EnKF) approach and quantile mapping. Results suggest that the presented methods are suitable for daily precipitation and temperature reconstruction. Evaluation experiments reveal excellent skill for temperature and good skill for precipitation. As illustrated with the example of the avalanche winter of 1887/88, these weather reconstructions have great potential for various analyses of past weather and for climate impact modelling.";2020;"weather, reconstruction, switzerland, high-resolution, spatial"

While progress has been made to mitigate and adapt to natural hazards, much of the existing research lacks interdisciplinary approaches that equally consider both natural and social processes. More importantly, this lack of integration between approaches remains a major challenge in developing disaster risk management plans for communities. In this study, we made a first attempt to develop a conceptual model of a coupled human-landscape system in Swiss Alpine communities. The conceptual model contains a system dynamics (e.g. interaction, feedbacks) component to reproduce community level, socio-economic developments and shocks that include economic crises leading to unemployment, depopulation and diminished community revenue. Additionally, the conceptual model contains climate, hydrology, and geomorphic components that are sources of natural hazards such as floods and debris flows. Feedbacks between the socio-economic and biophysical systems permit adaptation to flood and debris flow risks by implementing spatially explicit mitigation options including flood defenses and land cover changes. Here we justify the components, scales, and feedbacks present in the conceptual model and provide guidance on how to operationalize the conceptual model to assess risk and community resilience as well as determine which shocks overcome the buffering capacity of Swiss Alpine communities.";2020;"disasters, interdisciplinary, community, conceptual model, feedbacks"

DITIB is a Sunni-Islam based mosque organization that oversees over 900 mosques across Germany. However, the Turkish-Sunni diaspora does not consider DITIB mosques as simply religious or cultural spaces but instead attributes a highly complex quasi-stateness to it. My field research between 2016 and 2018 reveals that for this community, DITIB reflects an intimate familial version of the Turkish state in Germany. While DITIB has significant connections to the state in Turkey, based on my findings I argue that these connections alone do not explain why the diaspora perceive DITIB like a state. Rather, DITIB?s perceived stateness has been constructed through a historical process that brings to the fore diasporicexperiences, feelings, and memories centered at the ethnoreligious spaces of mosques. Thus, this research produces new questions for, and theoretical approaches to geographies of states, extending this literature?s emphasis on everyday and intimate perspectives. I build on feminist geopolitics and diaspora studies to contribute to this scholarship by analyzing the role of feelings and memories in forming perceptions of the state. I explain how spaces of perceived states become fluid, cross the borders of officially defined national territories, and exceed the classical spaces and embodiment of states. Instead, spaces like mosques come to be perceived like a state through their association with care, unity, and a home. This analysis points to the emotional and memory-based production of what is perceived as a state and how those perceptions are formed.";2020;"germany, mosque, perception, diaspora, state"

Here, we analyze a set of simulations with a single climate model consisting of a 2000-yr preindustrial control experiment, a 100-member historical ensemble, and a 100-member ensemble forced with an incremental CO2 increase by 1% yr?1. Compared to previous approaches, our setup offers the following advantages: First, the large ensemble size allows us to robustly separate internally and externally forced variability and to robustly detect statistical links between different quantities. Second, the availability of different scenarios allows us to investigate the role of the background state for drivers of the variability. We find strong evidence that ocean dynamics, particularly ocean heat transport variations, form an important contribution to generate the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) in the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model (MPI-ESM). Particularly the northwest North Atlantic is substantially affected by ocean circulation for the historical and preindustrial simulations. Anomalies of the Labrador Sea deep ocean density precede a change of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) and heat advection to the region south of Greenland. Under strong CO2 forcing, the AMV?SST regression pattern shows crucial changes: SST variability in the northwestern part of the North Atlantic is strongly reduced, so that the AMV pattern in this scenario is dominated by the low-latitude branch. We found a connection to changes in the deep-water formation that cause a strong reduction of the mean AMOC and its variability. Consequently, ocean heat transport convergence becomes less important for the SST variability south of Greenland.";2020;"ocean dynamics, variability, amv, heat transport, circulation"

We show how the combination of in-situ data, remote sensing observations and three-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical simulations is capable of delivering various spatio-temporal scales involved in lakes dynamics. This combination is achieved through data assimilation (DA) and uncertainty quantification. In this study, we present a flexible framework for DA into lakes three-dimensional hydrodynamic models. Using an Ensemble Kalman Filter, our approach accounts for model and observational uncertainties. We demonstrate the framework by assimilating in-situ and satellite remote sensing temperature data into a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake Geneva. Results show that DA effectively improves model performance over a broad range of spatio-temporal scales and physical processes. Overall, temperature errors have been reduced by 54-%. With a localization scheme, an ensemble size of 20 members is found to be sufficient to derive covariance matrices leading to satisfactory results.

Comparison of different methods at national level";"Tsolmongerel Papilloud and Veronika Eva R{\"o";"Assessing the flood exposure of infrastructure is crucial for sustainable flood risk management. We propose to define road exposure to floods as ?any road segment/element located within a flood hazard zone?. On the example of Switzerland, we develop and compare three methods to assess the flood exposure of the road infrastructure: absolute road area potentially flooded (method A), relative road area potentially flooded (method B), and a network-based approach using the edge betweenness centrality index (method C). The results are aggregated and ranked in grid cells of 2 km by 2 km for comparison. The ranks are directly proportional to exposure levels. The results present distinct spatial patterns; grid cells with higher values in method A indicate where more road surfaces are in a flood hazard zone (urban or high road density areas in flood plains), while method B highlights where most of the road surface is in flood hazard zones of predominantly mountainous areas of Switzerland. Higher values in method C present areas where the most-connected road links within a network are exposed to floods. Most of the grid cells that have higher values in method B than in method C indicate isolated mountain valleys that can be accessed only by a single road exposed to floods. The study demonstrates the importance of an appropriate choice of methods in flood exposure analysis. As exposure analysis is a key step in flood risk assessment, the presented results provide information essential for decision making in disaster risk reduction.";2020;"infrastructure, flood, exposure, methods, analysis"

However, their geolocation accuracy has not been comprehensively evaluated due to the difficulty caused by onboard resampling and the resulting coarse resolution, which hampers their usefulness in various applications. In this study, a correlation-based patch matching method (CPMM) was proposed to characterize and quantify the geo-location accuracy at the sub-pixel level for satellite data with coarse resolution, such as the AVHRR GAC dataset. This method is neither limited to landmarks nor suffers from errors caused by false detection due to the effect of mixed pixels caused by a coarse spatial resolution, and it thus enables a more robust and comprehensive geometric assessment than existing approaches. Data of NOAA-17, MetOp-A and MetOp-B satellites were selected to test the geocoding accuracy. The three satellites predominately present west shifts in the across-track direction, with average values of ?1.69, ?1.9, ?2.56-km and standard deviations of 1.32, 1.1, 2.19-km for NOAA-17, MetOp-A, and MetOp-B, respectively. The large shifts and uncertainties are partly induced by the larger satellite zenith angles (SatZs) and partly due to the terrain effect, which is related to SatZ and becomes apparent in the case of large SatZs. It is thus suggested that GAC data with SatZs less than 40? should be preferred in applications. The along-track geolocation accuracy is clearly improved compared to the across-track direction, with average shifts of ?0.7, ?0.02 and 0.96-km and standard deviations of 1.01, 0.79 and 1.70-km for NOAA-17, MetOp-A and MetOp-B, respectively.

Consequently, violence is a complex system instead of a norm located in certain places. In heavily militarised societies, patriarchal power regimes are even more prevalent because states? security strategies promote a masculinist understanding of protection as to who should be protected and by whom ? and from what. This study draws on feminist geopolitical analysis and explores how feminist activists in Honduras experience and resist violence in their everyday lives. The research is grounded in interviews, focus-group discussions and participant observation with Honduran activists. The findings demonstrate that violence and its effects are first embedded in women?s everyday lives through feelings of fear and unsafety on the streets, at the workplace and at home. Second, violence operates through structures and institutions such as the military and police, impunity for violence against women and the juridical restriction of reproductive rights. Third, the internationally financed war on drugs and ?development? projects contribute to violence, thus, there is a link between intimate experiences of violence and global economic and military powers that sustain violence. Activists therefore argue that, for their needs, the state?s and international organisations? security approaches are inadequate. The paper weaves together feminist visions of collective self-care and discusses activists? strategies against violence. This study contributes to a growing feminist geographic scholarship linking women?s bodily experiences with violence and responds to calls for complicating notions of violence.";2020;"feminist, violence, honduras, activism, global"

"990";"Assimilating monthly precipitation data in a paleoclimate data assimilation framework";"Veronika Valler and Yuri Brugnara and J{\"o";"Data assimilation approaches such as the ensemble Kalman filter method have become an important technique for paleoclimatological reconstructions and reanalysis. Different sources of information from proxy records and documentary data to instrumental measurements were assimilated in previous studies to reconstruct past climate fields. However, precipitation reconstructions are often based on indirect sources (e.g., proxy records). Assimilating precipitation measurements is a challenging task because they have high uncertainties, often represent only a small region and generally do not follow Gaussian distribution. In this paper, a set of experiments are conducted to test the possibility of using information about precipitation in climate reconstruction with monthly resolution by assimilating monthly instrumental precipitation amounts or the number of wet days per month, solely or in addition to other climate variables such as temperature and sea level pressure, into an ensemble of climate model simulations. The skill of all variables (temperature, precipitation, sea-level pressure) improved over the pure model simulations when only monthly precipitation amounts were assimilated. Assimilating the number of wet days resulted in similar or better skill compared to assimilating precipitation amount. The experiments with different types of instrumental observations being assimilated indicate that precipitation data can be useful, particularly if no other variable is available from a given region. Overall the experiments show promising results because with the assimilation of precipitation information a new data source can be exploited for climate reconstructions. Especially the wet day records can become an important data source in future climate reconstructions because many existing records date several centuries back in time and are not limited by the availability of meteorological instruments.";2020;"ensemble, assimilation, precipitation, climate, reconstructions"

This model was extended to traded services and, in the last 10 years, to the residential and presential economy, taking into account the fact that mobile consumers and residents also bring monetary flows into regions. The city today is both a productive agglomeration and a place of living, for both local and extra-local consumers, heralding the end of the primacy of manufacturing. In this article, we go a step further and consider the primacy of other kinds of export, either based on selling competitive goods or on attracting consumers. Due to changes in globalisation and to the rise of interurban competition for spending, incomes earned on exports are less and less likely to be spent locally, and instead flow out, progressively invalidating the multiplier effect. Consequently, the hypothesis of this article is that the main issue for urban development theories and practices is combining competitiveness in terms of exports with attractiveness to local as well as to external consumers. In this article, we call complexity the idea of pushing aside the focus on exports in order to understand the tensions and synergies between all activities and populations present within the urban space. In order to formulate new research questions, we build a typology of urban income flows and activities.";2020;"manufacturing, economy, exports, urban, consumers"

Although occurring in different centuries, all three events featured very similar precipitation patterns and an extratropical storm following a cyclonic, so-called Vb (five b of the van Bebber trajectories) trajectory around the Alps. Going back in time from the recent to the historical cases, we explore the potential of dynamical downscaling of a global reanalysis product from a grid size of 220 to 3-km. We investigate sensitivities of the simulated precipitation amounts to a set of differing configurations in the regional weather model. The best-performing model configuration in the evaluation, featuring a 1-d initialization period, is then applied to assess the sensitivity of simulated precipitation totals to cyclonic moisture flux along the downscaling steps. The analyses show that cyclone fields (closed pressure contours) and tracks (minimum pressure trajectories) are well defined in the reanalysis ensemble for the 2005 and 1910 cases, while deviations from the ensemble mean increase for the 1876 case. In the downscaled ensemble, the accuracy of simulated precipitation totals is closely linked to the exact trajectory and stalling position of the cyclone, with slight shifts producing erroneous precipitation, e.g., due to a break-up of the vortex if simulated too close to the Alpine topography. Simulated precipitation totals only reach the observed ones if the simulation includes continuous moisture fluxes of {ensuremath{>";2020;"precipitation, floods, switzerland, cyclone, downscaling"

While both human activity and climate variability have been implicated as degradation drivers, the lack of research fuels dispute over the status of land degradation in the Savannah and its drivers. Detailed correction evidence on the contributions of rainfall and human activities to land degradation can, however, help identify appropriate measures to address land degradation. MODIS vegetation ?greenness? and TAMSAT rainfall data were employed to achieve the following objectives: (i) provide empirical insights on the pattern of savannah vegetation dynamics; (ii) control for rainfall effects in Savannah degradation; (iii) characterize the extent, severity and geography of human-induced land degradation. The selected statistical techniques proved useful for highlighting the spatio-temporal dynamics of degradation in the NGS. Controlling for the effect of rainfall on vegetation greenness produces a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) residual that allows to estimate the human impact on land degradation. Despite no indication of a worsening rainfall regime, inter-annual variation in vegetation greenness exhibits a consistently negative, declining trend. This continuous, negative, declining trend in the NDVI residual strongly suggests ongoing biomass loss in the NGS is the result of unsustainable human activity. Observed improvement is attributable to existing land management programmes (afforestation and the planting of drought tolerant species) initiated by states in the zone. In sum, approximately 38% of the NGS land area, including protected areas such as Kainji Lake National Park, are becoming more degraded, while 14% and 48% of the remaining area shows either improvement or no real change, respectively. These results serve as a baseline information resource for tracking future land use activities, land degradation and potential pathways for achieving more sustainable land management.";2020;"savannah, degradation, rainfall, human, management"

The main differences among damage models are: (i) spatial scale, (ii) metric (i.e. absolute or relative loss), (iii) exposure assessment (i.e. whole building or affected floors, market values or reconstruction-replacement costs), (iv) number of input variables, (v) calibration/validation with observed losses.

However, this is complicated in sediment archives with associated hydrological catchments since the stored n-alkanes can have different ages and origins. 14C dating of the n-alkanes yields independent age information for these proxies, allowing their correct paleoenvironmental interpretation. This also holds true for fluvial sediment?paleosol sequences (FSPSs) that integrate two different n-alkane signals: (i) a catchment signal in fluvial sediments and (ii) an on-site signal from local biomass that increasingly dominates (paleo)soils with time. Therefore, the age and origin of n-alkanes in FSPSs are complex: in fluvial sediment layers they can be pre-aged and reworked when originating from eroded catchment soils or from organic-rich sediment rocks in the catchment. In (paleo)soils, besides an inherited contribution from the catchment, they were formed on-site by local biomass during pedogenesis. Depending on the different relative contributions from these sources, the n-alkane signal from an FSPS shows variable age offsets between its formation and final deposition.  During this study, we applied compound-class 14C dating to n-alkanes from an FSPS along the upper Alazani in eastern Georgia. Our results show that preheating the n-alkanes with 120 ?C for 8 h before 14C dating effectively removed the shorter chains ({ensuremath{<";2020;"leaf, wax, n-alkanes, dating, fluvial"

We  argue  that  land  plays  a  central  role  in  the  complex  interplay  of  state  formation,  armed  conflict  and  international  development  in  Myanmar?s  con-tested borderlands and that land conflicts can provide an entry point to make sense of these dynamics. We use ethnographic data and a framework combining Deleuze and Guattari?s concept of assemblages with Foucault?s conception of power to pro-vide a detailed analysis of a multi-stakeholder platform (MSP) addressing land dis-putes  in  Myanmar?s  south-east.  Analysing  the  platform?s  discourses,  practices  and  technologies, we argue that, despite its emphasis on inclusion, participation and dia-logue,  it  is  the  operation  of  power  that  upholds  this  inherently  conflictive  assem-blage. The platform opens spaces for agency for less-influential actors, but it equally produces  de-politicising  and  exclusive  effects.  While  scholars  have  typically  used  assemblage  thinking  to  analyse  how  state  authority  is  disassembled  by  the  grow-ing  role  of  non-state  actors,  we  aim  to  further  post-structural  reflections  on  state  formation and international development by arguing that the central state in Myan-mar actually expands its reach into the borderlands through assemblages such as the MSP. This happens at the expense of the authority of quasi-state formations of eth-nic armed organisations. Thus, this process is reminiscent of how the Burmese state expanded its reach through assemblages of land and resource extraction during the ?ceasefire capitalism? before the transition.";2020;"myanmar, land, conflict, power, state"

At the same time, digital technologies emerged and rural communities experience profound transformations. In this chapter, we analyze how technological change leads to changing rural economies in a Swiss mountain community. Although Switzerland has one of the highest national coverage of broadband in the world, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the transformation of its rural economy due to digitalization. The community case study?s 46 qualitative interviews show that digital connectivity in peripheral mountain communities is experienced differently by various actors. On the one hand, digitalization offers new economic opportunities to larger businesses, larger hotels, schools and health service providers. On the other hand, particularly smaller businesses struggle with the high cost of becoming digital and their owners tend to become more cautious and stressed as competition and price transparencies in the digital economy become intensified. In terms of spatial aspects, we argue that digitalization reduces cognitive distance between core and periphery while physical distance between the urban and the rural still exist.";2020;"rural, economy, digitalization, swiss, community"

Knowing the average dependence of summer flow on winter precipitation is an essential context for comparing regional drought severity and provides the hydrological template for downstream water users and ecosystems. However, Fyw estimation based on seasonal signals of stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen has not yet explicitly addressed how to parsimoniously include the seasonal shift of water input from snow. Using experimental data from three high-elevation, Alpine catchments (one dominated by glacier and two by snow), we propose a framework to explicitly include the delays induced by snow storage into estimates of Fyw. Scrutinizing the key methodological choices when estimating Fyw from isotope data, we find that the methods used to construct precipitation input signals from sparse isotope samples can significantly impact Fyw. Given this sensitivity, our revised procedure estimates a distribution of Fyw values that incorporates a wide range of possible methodological choices and their uncertainties; it furthermore compares the commonly used amplitude ratio approach to a direct convolution approach, which circumvents the assumption that the isotopic signals have a sine curve shape, an assumption that is generally violated in snow-dominated environments. Our new estimates confirm that high-elevation Alpine catchments have low Fyw values, spanning from 8 to 11%. Such low values have previously been interpreted as the impact of seasonal snow storage alone, but our comparison of different Fyw estimation methods suggests that these low Fyw values result from a combination of both snow cover effects and longer storage in the subsurface. In contrast, in the highest elevation, glacier dominated catchment, Fyw is 3?4 times greater compared to the other two catchments, due to the lower storage and faster drainage processes. A future challenge, capturing spatio-temporal snowmelt isotope signals during winter baseflow and the snowmelt period, remains to improve constraints on the Fyw estimation technique.";2020;"young, water, fraction, estimation, seasonal, snow, isotopes, methodological, alpine, catchments"

High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) can provide a more comprehensive picture of exposure to harmful chemicals, particularly through the retrospective analysis of digitally stored HRMS data. Using this methodology, our study characterized  the contamination of various environmental compartments including 154 surface water, 46 urban effluent, 67 sediment, 15 soil, 34 groundwater, 24 biofilm, 41 gammarid and 49 fish samples at 95 sites widely distributed over the Swiss Plateau. As a proof-of-concept, we focused our investigation on antifungal azoles, a class of chemicals of emerging concern due to their endocrine disrupting effects on aquatic organisms and humans. Our results demonstrated the occurrence of antifungal azoles and some of their (bio)transformation products in all the analyzed compartments (0.1?100 ng/L or ng/gd.w.). Comparison of actual and predicted concentrations showed the partial suitability of level 1 fugacitymodelling in predicting the exposure to azoles. Risk quotient calculations additionally revealed risk of exposure especially if some of the investigated rivers and streams are used for drinking water production. The case study clearly shows that the retrospective analysis of HRMS/MS data can improve the current knowledge on exposure and the related risks to chemicals of emerging concern and can be effectively employed in the future for such purposes.";2020;"risk, assessment, mass, spectrometry, exposure"

Aqua/Terra MODIS products provide about 20-year daily snow-cover data with 500 m spatial resolution. MODIS Collection 6 represents the most recent release of global snow-cover mapping algorithms and could further increase the high accuracy of previous collections: snow cover is now reported by its NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) values, allowing more flexibility in using the datasets for specific regions than previous releases. We quantified the potential-added value of tuning the NDSI threshold as opposed to a global snow-detection algorithm by developing a 16-year snow-cover climatology for the Central Apennines (Italy) from daily observations in MODIS snow products Collection 5 (C5) and Collection 6 (C6). Seven ground-based stations were used as independent benchmark. Three versions of binary snow-cover maps were generated from the NDSI Snow Cover product (C6), using NDSI-threshold tests for snow detection. The most accurate snow-cover maps show an agreement with available ground data of 88% for Aqua and 89% for Terra MODIS, with an improvement compared to snow-cover maps obtained from C5 Snow Cover Area (SCA) products (yielding 86% for Aqua and 88% for Terra). NDSI thresholds in the range 0.10-0.40 provide an agreement higher than 83% but snow-cover duration, distribution, and spatial extent are sensible to the NDSI threshold: if compared to the optimal NDSI threshold for this region (0.20), the value of 0.40 reduces by 15% the snow-cover extent in all seasons due to increased underestimation. The lowest tested threshold (0.10) estimates at least 10% larger snow-cover fraction in winter and spring but increases commission errors. This high sensitivity to the NDSI threshold makes its choice an essential step for using MODIS C6 snow products in hydrologic or climatologic studies.";2020;"remotely, sensed, snow-cover, ndsi, threshold"

To reconcile these concerns, the Swiss voting majority agreed to introduce densification as a legally binding policy objective in 2013. Simultaneously, however, densification processes have started to threaten the housing situation of low- and middle-income tenants due to higher rents following redevelopment. In this article, we argue that the Swiss way of implementing densification is characterised by a systematic bypassing of tenants? needs for social sustainability in housing due to the current political priorities of the Swiss federal government. Using an institutionalist analysis approach and a qualitative case-study methodology, we analyse the institutional mechanisms and the actors? rationale behind this emerging business of densification. Finally, we discuss the role of the nation state in the provision of the ?right to housing? for all income segments and its consequences for the country?s long-term sustainability performance.";2020;"switzerland, urban sprawl, densification, tenants, sustainability"

"1027";"Improving the Predictive Skill of a Distributed Hydrological Model by Calibration on Spatial Patterns With Multiple Satellite Data Sets";"Moctar Demb{'e";"Abstract Hydrological model calibration combining Earth observations and in situ measurements is a promising solution to overcome the limitations of the traditional streamflow-only calibration. However, combining multiple data sources in model calibration requires a meaningful integration of the data sets, which should harness their most reliable contents to avoid accumulation of their uncertainties and mislead the parameter estimation procedure. This study analyzes the improvement of model parameter selection by using only the spatial patterns of satellite remote sensing data, thereby ignoring their absolute values. Although satellite products are characterized by uncertainties, their most reliable key feature is the representation of spatial patterns, which is a unique and relevant source of information for distributed hydrological models. We propose a novel multivariate calibration framework exploiting spatial patterns and simultaneously incorporating streamflow and three satellite products (i.e., Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model [GLEAM] evaporation, European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative [ESA CCI] soil moisture, and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment [GRACE] terrestrial water storage). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature data set is used for model evaluation. A bias-insensitive and multicomponent spatial pattern matching metric is developed to formulate a multiobjective function. The proposed multivariate calibration framework is tested with the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) and applied to the poorly gauged Volta River basin located in a predominantly semiarid climate in West Africa. Results of the multivariate calibration show that the decrease in performance for streamflow (?7%) and terrestrial water storage (?6%) is counterbalanced with an increase in performance for soil moisture (+105%) and evaporation (+26%). These results demonstrate that there are benefits in using satellite data sets, when suitably integrated in a robust model parametrization scheme.";2020;"hydrological, calibration, spatial patterns, satellite, multivariate"

We apply what we call the \"forest-water and land-atmosphere interaction lens\" to current strategies for improving landscape resilience in the West African Sahel and the concept of the Great Green Wall (GGW). The severe and extensive drought of the 1970's?1990's led many to assess future climate and promote strategies to counter the gradual southward expansion of the Sahara. The idea for the GGW, a wall of trees intended to slow desert encroachment, grew out of this period of tremendous upheaval and human tragedy. Despite partial recovery in the local rainfall regime, we know far too little about whether the GGW strategy can even work. Further, it seems disingenuous to ignore the climatic envelope, which sets the boundaries within which forest-water and land-atmosphere interactions occur. Applying the ?forest-water and land-atmosphere interaction lens? to landscape restoration as a tool for achieving improved resilience and human welfare in the Sahel provides meaningful input for re-thinking the GGW strategy. We upgrade current knowledge with the specific biophysical conditions likely to better support appropriate forest-water and land atmosphere interactions in the region and further fit such approaches within the context of the climatic envelope. The principal components of an improved strategy include a focus on large scale precipitation recycling all the way from the West African coast on into the Sahel, as well as improved tree, shrub and forest cover in the Sahel proper to promote infiltration, groundwater recharge, rainfall triggering potential and land surface cooling. Agroforestry can further broadly promote landscape resilience in the greater region. Strategies broadly focused on increasing rainfall recycling, water availability and the promotion of landscape resilience appear more likely to steer future efforts in useful directions.";2020;"climate, forest-water, land-atmosphere, sahel, ggw"

We analysed lake sediments from Limni Zazari (Northern Greece) to reconstruct the past local vegetation and fre history with a special focus on land use and its impacts on erosion and lake eutrophication. Our data suggest a rather dense steppic vegetation after ca 20,000 cal bp (18050 cal bc). Forest expansion with Pinus sylvestris and admixed Quercus pubescens started around 14,500 cal bp (12550 cal bc). After the onset of the Holocene, mixed deciduous sub-mediterranean oak forests expanded, accompanied by rapidly decreasing soil erosion rates and increasing aquatic biological productivity. Pollen of cereals and Plantago lanceolata suggests continuous farming activities in the region after 8,200 cal bp (6250 cal bc), in agreement with archaeological evidence. Fairly closed mixed pine-oak forests dominated the landscape until ca 3,500 cal bp (1550 cal bc) that were only temporarily reduced during the Neolithic around 7,100 and 6,500 cal bp (5150 and 4550 cal bc). Land cover changes and aquatic biogeochemistry were closely linked during this period. Forest phases corresponded to lake eutrophication and hypolimnetic anoxia (meromixis), whereas during periods of deforestation (e.g. around 8,200 cal bp/6250 cal bc) soil erosion rates and lake mixing increased, while aquatic productivity decreased. After 3,500 cal bp (1550 cal bc) humans disrupted forests and open land vegetation expanded (e.g. Artemisia, Rumex-type, Cichorioideae, Chenopodiaceae). With the onset of the Iron Age (ca. 3,050 cal bp/1100 cal bc) grassland communities expanded massively and pine-oak forests gradually declined. Anthropogenic pressure on forests increased even more during the past 500 years. Finally, forest recovery during the recent decades led to decreased erosion and increased lake productivity. We conclude that over the millennia, intense pastoral and arable activities shaped both aquatic and terrestrial environments, ultimately creating a humanized vegetation mosaic in which the original natural mixed deciduous oak forests only form relict stands. Future climate warming and decreasing anthropogenic pressure may release a rapid spread of mixed deciduous oak forests around Limni Zazari.";2020;"vegetation, fire, land use, lake, erosion"

However, there are still many diverging views on what sustainable intensification means, and how to get there. In this article, we present a conceptual framework to navigate agricultural intensification pathways. The conceptual framework aligns three research themes central to improving the sustainability of agriculture: (1) What are the social, economic, and environmental trade-offs of alternative agricultural intensification options? (2) How do land managers decide on intensification strategies, and how can the adoption of sustainable practices be made more attractive? (3) How do socio-political, technological, and environmental mega-trends and other drivers of change affect sustainable intensification measures and agricultural landscapes? The framework presented here goes beyond earlier frameworks by considering multiple dimensions of intensity and sustainability, drawing from both natural and social science theories. Also, it operates across spatial and temporal scales, and is outcome-focused while explicitly considering the linkages between decision making processes and sustainability outcomes. We argue that given these novelties the conceptual framework can serve as a blueprint to assess pathways towards sustainable agricultural intensification.";2020;"sustainable, intensification, pathways, framework, agriculture"

In the future, land use activities are likely to expand and/or intensify further to meet growing demands for food, fiber, and energy. As part of the World Climate Research Program Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), the international community has developed the next generation of advanced Earth system models (ESMs) to estimate the combined effects of human activities (e.g., land use and fossil fuel emissions) on the carbon-climate system. A new set of historical data based on the History of the Global Environment database (HYDE), and multiple alternative scenarios of the future (2015-2100) from Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) teams, is required as input for these models.

Considering the global call for SLM, and due to a lack of studies on land degradation (LD) in Tunisia, we aimed to explore the livelihoods of farmers, their livelihoods strategies and perceptions about LD and land management, in order to design SLM in rural areas in Tunisia. We used the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA) to analyse the livelihoods assets, livelihoods strategies, and the perceptions of people about LD and SLM. Through structured interviews with 90 households, we collected both quantitative and qualitative data on household assets, strategies, and perceptions. Results indicate variation in the status of livelihoods among households, which influences their livelihoods strategies and consequently livelihoods outcomes. When facing environmental issues, farm households apply various livelihoods strategies to shield themselves from negative impacts and shocks. Our study revealed that farmers in the high-livelihoods-assets category chose economic returns over environmental benefits. Farmers in the low-livelihoods-assets category have generated livelihoods strategies that lead to inappropriate management strategies due to low access to assets and, as a result, contributed to LD. This is because these farmers are more concerned about the immediate constraints of their livelihoods and subsistence than the medium and long-term sustainable land management. Compared to the other two groups, farmers in the medium-livelihoods assets category have the best perceptions and flexibility for SLM compared to the other two categories. Thus, as the quality of land is highly dependent on the way it is managed, environmental and land management planning, and policies should not only consider the rehabilitation of land but also require a better understanding of the livelihoods, strategies and perceptions of people as these remain key drivers that affect land condition.";2020;"livelihoods, strategies, perceptions, land management, farmers"

Especially, flood events might transport large pesticide loads downstream and impact adjacent areas such as sensible floodplain environments by deposing particle bound pesticides or by contaminating the environments by dissolved substances directly. Unfortunately, only little attempts were made to quantify the pesticide pollution of such environments, as the monitoring of soil and sediment contamination is by far more time consuming and complicated compared to the analysis of water samples. Materials and methods: In the study presented, we therefore used a holistic approach starting with the reconstruction of the inundation characteristics of a floodplain located in the upper part of the river Elbe, Germany, by using nearby gauging data, screened databases for pesticide concentrations and calculated pesticide loads, and finally, sampled the floodplain soils along an elevation (inundation) gradient. Results: As expected, the reconstructed inundation characteristics showed that the low-lying areas of the backwater inflow of the floodplain were flooded more frequently compared to the areas at higher elevation, whereby even the highest elevations sampled were at least flooded during each decade. Furthermore, pesticide concentrations of the river waters and calculated pesticide loads revealed that 13 pesticides can be found regularly, whereby atrazine, terbuthylazine, metazachlor, metolachlor, isoproturon, and chlorotoluron are the main contaminants. Conclusion: Concluding, a spatial pattern in the contamination could be detected. High residues of simazine and ethofumesate were associated with areas of less and more frequent inundations, respectively. The transformation products of atrazine and terbuthylazine (2-hydroxy-atrazine and 2-hydroxy-terbuthylazine) were detected, whereby the quantity could be well explained by the inundation characteristics and pesticide loads of the river water.";2020;"pesticide, river, floodplain, contamination, soil"

Disaster risk management actions are commonly divided into the different steps of the disaster management cycle, which include: prevention, to minimize future losses; preparedness and crisis management, often focused on saving lives; and post-crisis management aiming at re-establishing services supporting human activities. Based on a literature review and examples of studies in the area of coastal, hydro-meteorological and geohazards, this review examines how space-based Earth observations have addressed the needs for information in the area of disaster risk management so far. We show that efforts have essentially focused on hazard assessments or supporting crisis management, whereas a number of needs still remain partly fulfilled for vulnerability and exposure mapping, as well as adaptation planning. A promising way forward to maximize the impact of Earth observations includes multi-risk approaches, which mutualize the collection of time-evolving vulnerability and exposure data across different hazards. Opportunities exist as programmes such as the Copernicus Sentinels are now delivering Earth observations of an unprecedented quality, quantity and repetitiveness, as well as initiatives from the disaster risk science communities such as the development of observatories. We argue that, as a complement to this, more systematic efforts to (1) build capacity and (2) evaluate where space-based Earth observations can support disaster risk management would be useful to maximize its societal benefits.";2020;"earth, observations, disaster, risk, management"

"1063";"Schl{\"u";"Heike Mayer";"Innovation processes are often conceptualized with an urban bias and are therefore theorized solely considering the perspective of the urban environment (e.g. close face-to-face contacts, dense urban milieus, fast interactions between a multitude and diverse actors, etc.). As a result, innovation theories do not sufficiently consider the context of the periphery and how this context may foster or hinder the development of innovative products, technologies and services. In the meantime, economic geographers started to  conceptualize  innovation  processes  in  peripheral  locations  as  ?slow  innovation? (Shearmur 2015, 2017; Shearmur  & Doloreux, 2016) and they have emphasized the need to consider innovative processes as more isolated, less dependent on frequent interactions with  partners  and  more  strategic in  terms  of  seeking information  and knowledge. Another stream of research that recently emerged, considers the periphery as a space in which creativity can more freely unfold because innovators are positioned at the fringes and are more free to experiment with unconventional ideas (Grabher2018). Less emphasis has been placed on the notion that peripheral spaces can also offer opportunities for experimentation because they afford innovative actors the opportunity to reflect, search, experiment and advance in undisturbed, more ?slow? ways, perhaps because they by choice are shielded from accelerating economic pressures. In this sense, the relative emptiness or thinness of the periphery can be considered not only as an asset for innovation, but also as an empowering characteristic for innovative behavior. This exploratory essay examines these processes through exploratory case studies of slow innovators in peripheral regions in the European Alps (Italy and Austria).";2020;"innovation,periphery,slow,exploration,empowerment"

Despite the wealth of meteorological and hydrological data, few studies have quantified observed stream temperature trends in the Alps. This study presents a detailed analysis of stream temperature and discharge in 52 catchments in Switzerland, a country covering a wide range of alpine and lowland hydrological regimes. The influence of discharge, precipitation, air temperature, and upstream lakes on stream temperatures and their temporal trends is analysed from multi-decadal to seasonal timescales. Stream temperature has significantly increased over the past 5 decades, with positive trends for all four seasons. The mean trends for the last 20 years are + 0.37 +/- 0.11 degrees C per decade for water temperature, resulting from the joint effects of trends in air temperature (+0.39 +/- 0.14 degrees C per decade), discharge (-10.1 +/- 4.6 % per decade), and precipitation (-9.3 +/- 3.4 % per decade). For a longer time period (1979-2018), the trends are +0.33 +/- 0.03 degrees C per decade for water temperature, +0.46 +/- 0.03 degrees C per decade for air temperature, -3.0 +/- 0.5 % per decade for discharge, and -1.3 +/- 0.5 % per decade for precipitation. Furthermore, we show that snow and glacier melt compensates for air temperature warming trends in a transient way in alpine streams. Lakes, on the contrary, have a strengthening effect on downstream water temperature trends at all elevations. Moreover, the identified stream temperature trends are shown to have critical impacts on ecological and economical temperature thresholds (the spread of fish diseases and the usage of water for industrial cooling), especially in lowland rivers, suggesting that these waterways are becoming more vulnerable to the increasing air temperature forcing. Resilient alpine rivers are expected to become more vulnerable to warming in the near future due to the expected reductions in snow-and glacier-melt inputs.

Mayle";"Amazonia is the world?s largest tropical forest and is globally important in terms of its ecosystem services and extraordinarily high levels of biodiversity. The origin of this biodiversity has long been attributed to purely natural drivers, with little consideration given to the legacy of millennia of human land use. Here, the potential contribution of pre-Columbian human activity (prior 1492 CE) to current patterns of plant diversity in Amazonia is explored via long-term (palaeoecology, archaeology) and short-term (botany, plant ecology) studies. The aim of the chapter is to examine the information available to date, and discuss recent advances and persisting shortcomings relevant to the extent to which pre-Columbian human societies influenced patterns of Amazonian plant diversity. This topic has been the subject of long-standing scientific debate over several decades, and among diverse disciplines. In recent years, this debate has intensified following the development of new techniques and data. The findings indicate that humans have had an impact upon Amazonian plant diversity for over 13,000 years. Late Pleistocene/early Holocene humans domesticated numerous plant species and may have inadvertently caused long-lasting ecosystem changes by contributing to Pleistocene megafauna extinction. Based on our literature review, we identify four key types of pre-Columbian anthropogenic impact, leaving a clear legacy upon current patterns of plant diversity: (1) construction of vast earthworks, which has altered forest and savannah cover through changes in micro-topography, fire use and hydrology, (2) widespread distribution and dispersal of domesticated plants, (3) the creation of exceptionally fertile, anthropogenic soils, which enabled continuous, intensive agro-forestry, and (4) the enrichment of plant communities with edible and useful species. We argue that knowledge of the degree to which humans have shaped plant diversity over the past several millennia has relevance for developing sustainable land use and improving our understanding of the likely responses of Amazonian ecosystems to environmental and anthropogenic disturbance.";2020;"amazonia, biodiversity, pre-columbian, impact, plant"

Drawing on a comprehensive national dataset on land concessions in Laos, and 2005 and 2015 village- level poverty rates, we examine the association between land-based investments and poverty at the village level in Lao rural areas. Results outline contexts in which land-based investments have either positive or adverse association with village-level poverty change rates; they also reveal factors that determine village-level poverty reduction in Laos. Our results suggest that poverty rates in villages affected by land-based investments decreased significantly between 2005 and 2015, following the national trend in Laos. However, in cases where land-based investments caused more farmland loss, poverty reduction was low or poverty rates increased over this period. Results further reveal that land-based investments implemented in more remote areas or poorer villages had a stronger association with poverty reduction. However, poverty was not a central consideration for the establishment of land-based investments.

In order to avoid the effort of manually setting ground control points (GCPs) for each webcam, we implement a novel registration approach that automatically resolves camera parameters (camera orientation; principal point; field of view, FOV) by using an estimate of the webcams' positions and a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM). Furthermore, we propose an automatic image-to-image alignment to correct small changes in camera orientation and compare and analyze two recent snow classification methods.

In addition to soil colour and contents of Fed, we explore mean soil reflectance spectra (MSRS) measured by analytical spectral devices (ASD) and analyse the morphological conditions of the spectra referring to the effects of iron oxides on spectral behaviours. Results show a high correlation of spectral behaviours and colour variations with Fe oxides, and no correlation with soil organic carbon Corg. The influence of the Fe oxide contents is clearly apparent in the visible range (VIS). The presence of CaCO3 increases the reflectance in all spectral ranges. Six soil groups (Gr. I ? Gr.

Here, we bridge the gap between our contributions to PlioMIP1 (Stepanek and Lohmann, 2012) and PlioMIP2 (Stepanek et al., 2020). We highlight some of the effects that differences in the chosen mid-Pliocene model setup (PlioMIP2 vs. PlioMIP1) have on the climate state as derived with COSMOS, as this information will be valuable in the framework of the model?model and model?data comparison within PlioMIP2. We evaluate the model sensitivity to improved mid-Pliocene boundary conditions using PlioMIP's core mid-Pliocene experiments for PlioMIP1 and PlioMIP2 and present further simulations in which we test model sensitivity to variations in paleogeography, orbit, and the concentration of CO2.  Firstly, we highlight major changes in boundary conditions from PlioMIP1 to PlioMIP2 and also the challenges recorded from the initial effort. The results derived from our simulations show that COSMOS simulates a mid-Pliocene climate state that is 0.29-?C colder in PlioMIP2 if compared to PlioMIP1 (17.82-?C in PlioMIP1, 17.53-?C in PlioMIP2; values based on simulated surface skin temperature). On the one hand, high-latitude warming, which is supported by proxy evidence of the mid-Pliocene, is underestimated in simulations of both PlioMIP1 and PlioMIP2. On the other hand, spatial variations in surface air temperature (SAT), sea surface temperature (SST), and the distribution of sea ice suggest improvement of simulated SAT and SST in PlioMIP2 if employing the updated paleogeography. Our PlioMIP2 mid-Pliocene simulation produces warmer SSTs in the Arctic and North Atlantic Ocean than those derived from the respective PlioMIP1 climate state. The difference in prescribed CO2 accounts for 0.5-?C of temperature difference in the Arctic, leading to an ice-free summer in the PlioMIP1 simulation, and a quasi ice-free summer in PlioMIP2. Beyond the official set of PlioMIP2 simulations, we present further simulations and analyses that sample the phase space of potential alternative orbital forcings that have acted during the Pliocene and may have impacted geological records. Employing orbital forcing, which differs from that proposed for PlioMIP2 (i.e., corresponding to pre-industrial conditions) but falls into the mid-Pliocene time period targeted in PlioMIP, leads to pronounced annual and seasonal temperature variations. Our result identifies the changes in mid-Pliocene paleogeography from PRISM3 to PRISM4 as the major driver of the mid-Pliocene warmth within PlioMIP and not the minor differences in forcings.";2020;"cosmos, pliomip1, pliomip2, boundary, sensitivity"

More recent geographic work on reproduction, however, is inspired by feminist, Black, postcolonial, and critical theories to address the uneven geographies of access to spaces of reproductive health and justice. Research in the field of reproductive geography increasingly employs an intersectional perspective investigating how questions of reproductive rights intersect with environmental, racial, sexual, and gender justice. While research on intimate geopolitics looks at how reproductive freedom and autonomy are embedded in wider geopolitical, geoeconomic, and biopolitical power relations, reproductive geographies study the spaces, mobilities, and practices of fertility, pregnancy, and birth.";2020;"reproductive, rights, feminist, geographies, intersectional"

In recent years, coastal SES are experiencing severe threat from an increasing population, resource exploitation, and global environmental change (e.g. climate change), which have devastating societal impacts in coastal areas. Despite several global, national, and local initiatives, there is a growing consensus that coastal resources are depleting and increasing conflicts in coastal areas. Recognizing the global call to understand social?ecological interactions for implementing development practices, this special issue features a suite (seven) of articles advancing the understanding of the sustainability of social and ecological interactions within coastal areas through theoretical SES approaches and related analytical methods. In this editorial of this special issue, we also argued that coastal area needs to define from SES perspectives, which have received less attention compared to ecological and social perspectives. We hope that this special issue will stimulate the debate and further thinking of how coastal SES can be managed sustainably by conceptualizing and understanding the complex dynamics (interaction, feedback) of SES.";2020;"coastal, social-ecological, sustainability, interactions, resources"

The integration of social wellbeing into the SOS concept through defining boundaries for humanity has become known as a SJOS concept. Although various studies have attempted to operationalize this SJOS concept, no synthesis has been conducted of the progress made and the obstacles faced. To address this need, we reviewed empirical studies and developed a conceptual framework of four operational steps for identifying the challenges and opportunities in operationalizing SJOS for regional social-ecological systems (SES). The steps include: 1) Understanding the SES to investigate the genesis in terms of selecting indicators and contextualization, which also include challenges such as selection of indicators, data availability and framework development to operationalize the SJOS concept; 2) Exploring the systems by understanding and unravelling the SES dynamics (e.g. feedbacks, nonlinearity) due to the limitation of existing modelling approaches; 3) Understanding the system governance by integrating stakeholders? visions and equity dimension of sustainability and conceptualizing the SJOS; 4) The communication of SJOS entails additional layers of complexity as this concept integrates diverse challenges (e.g. equity) and disciplines into the sustainability assessment. In contrast, overcoming the challenges offers opportunities for transformation to sustainability within the limits of SES across different scales. The operational framework can thus be used in assessing the sustainability of SES.";2020;"global, challenges, social, operationalizing, sustainability"

In contexts with limited data, conceptual system dynamic models offer a promising entry point to overcome challenges in understanding SES dynamics, which is essential for managing the long-term sustainability of SES and human wellbeing. Here, we build on previous work focused on agricultural production and use participatory approaches to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD) model for the south-west coastal SES in Bangladesh encompassing multiple forms of livelihood (fisheries, shrimp farming and forests, as well as agriculture). Using qualitative methods, including focus group discussions with farmers, fishermen, shrimp farmers and forest people, as well as expert consultations, we identified interactions, feedback loops and thresholds for the SES. The conceptual system model developed independently by stakeholders is consistent with a model developed using an empirical approach and literature review. Feedback loops are identified for the ecological (e.g. climate and water, mangrove and salinity) and social (e.g. shrimp farming and mangrove, agricultural (e.g. crops) production and subsidy) sub-systems in the Bangladesh delta. The biophysical thresholds that impact social conditions include river water discharge (1500 to 2000 m3 s?1), climate (28 ?C) and soil salinity ({texttt{char126";2020;"ses, dynamics, model, stakeholders, bangladesh"

Visualizations are a powerful tool to communicate knowledge about telecoupling phenomena. However, little is known about current practices of telecoupling visualization and the challenges involved in visually displaying connections between multiple social-ecological systems. Our research takes stock of existing telecoupling visualizations and provides recommendations for improving current practices. We systematically review 118 visualizations presented in the scientific literature on telecoupling, and assess them in terms of their content and the adopted visualization approaches. To this end, we conceptualize telecoupling visualizations through a network lens. We find that they typically present networks of social-ecological systems, which are linked through flows. Displays of telecoupling connections through actor networks or action situation networks are less frequent. We categorize the existing visualizations into seven main types, which differ in terms of the visual encoding strategies used to represent telecoupling components. We then draw on insights from data visualization literature to reflect critically upon these current practices and provide practical recommendations. Finally, we show that network perspectives are inherent in telecoupling research and visualizations, and may deserve further attention in this field.";2020;"telecoupling, visualization, networks, connections, social-ecological"
"1096";"Impact through participatory research approaches: an archetype analysis";"Theresa Margarete Tribaldos and Christoph Oberlack and Flurina Schneider";"Participatory research approaches are often assumed to be effective for addressing sustainability problems that involve a substantial amount of complexity, uncertainty, and conflicting values. The adaptive and integrative character of these approaches engages various scientific and nonscientific actors in collective knowledge production processes. An increasing number of case studies documents pathways to impact triggered by participatory research approaches. However, cumulative learning across cases about the impacts of participatory research projects remains limited to date. One question is of particular interest, namely how and when different intensities of actor interactions in participatory research effectively contribute to advancing sustainable development.In this paper we address this knowledge gap by presenting a meta-analysis of 29 case studies of participatory research projects in agricultural settings. The study protocol follows systematic case retrieval and selection, coding, and data analysis through formal concept analysis. We introduce and utilize a new diagnostic framework to analyze the links between the intensity of actor interactions,sustainability impact goals, context conditions, and sustainability impacts. The results show that three archetypical patterns describe how the 29 case studies report that participatory research projects generate sustainability impacts: learning, knowledge products, and real-world transformations. Impact in all three patterns is consistently associated with higher intensities of interactions, i.e., coproduction and less consultation but not mere information. The most frequently reported impact is learning in a context of resources and environment problems. In this configuration, coproduction of knowledge is mainly used during the second research phase. However,the results also show that coproduction in the final phase of a participatory research project is more often used to achieve the impact of real-world transformations, which presumably involves more complexity and contestation than other impacts. We conclude that participatory research projects, which aim at transformative impacts in complex settings beyond knowledge products and learning,need to sustain high intensities of actor interactions in knowledge coproduction throughout all research phases to achieve their sustainability impact goals.";2020;"participatory, research, sustainability, impacts, interactions"

The presence of the arsenite (As(III)) methyltransferase gene (arsM) in soil microbes has been used as an indication of their capacity for As methylation. Here, we evaluate the  ability of seven microorganisms encoding active ArsM enzymes to methylate As. Amongst those, only the aerobic species were efficient methylators. The anaerobic microorganisms presented high resistance to As exposure, presumably through their efficient As(III) efflux, but methylated As  poorly. The only exception were methanogens, for which efficient As methylation was seemingly an artifact of membrane disruption. Deletion of an efflux pump gene (acr3) in one of the anaerobes, Clostridium pasteurianum, rendered the strain sensitive to As and capable of more efficiently methylating As. Our results led to the following conclusions: (i) encoding a functional ArsM enzyme does not guarantee that a microorganism will actively drive As methylation in the presence of the metalloid and (ii) there is an inverse relationship between efficient microbial As efflux and its methylation, because the former prevents the intracellular accumulation of As.";2020;"arsM, as, methylation, microorganisms, efflux"

However, the non-stationarity of this relationship could impact its use for prediction routines. Here we use snow products fromlong-term reanalyses to investigate interannual and interdecadal links between autumnal snow cover and atmo-spheric conditions in winter. We find evidence for a negative NAO-like signal after November with a strongwest-to-east snow cover gradient, which is valid throughout the last 150 years. This correlation is consistentlylinked to a weak stratospheric polar vortex state. Nevertheless, decadal evolution of this link shows episodes ofdecreased correlation strength, which co-occur with episodes of low variability in the November snow index.By contrast, periods with high prediction skill for winter NAO are found in periods of high November snowvariability, which co-occur with the Arctic warming periods of the 20th century, namely the early 20th-centuryArctic warming between 1920 and 1940 and the ongoing anthropogenic global warming at the end of the 20thcentury.

We explore what approaches align with plural valuation on the ground, as well as how different social-ecological contexts play a role in translating plural valuation into decisions and outcomes. Based on a co-constructed analytical approach relying on empirical information from ten cases from the Global South, we find that plural valuation contributes to equitable and sustainable outcomes if the valuation process: 1) is based on participatory value elicitation approaches; 2) is framed with a clear action-oriented purpose; 3) provides space for marginalized stakeholders to articulate their values in ways that can be included in decisions; 4) is used as a tool to identify and help reconcile different cognitive models about human-nature relations; and 5) fosters open communication and collaboration among stakeholders. We also find that power asymmetries can hinder plural valuation.

In the province of Salta, Argentina, thedeforestation rate is particularly high, with substantial environmental and social impacts. The province is characterized by the presence of various actors (large-scaleproducers, small-scale farmers, indigenous peoples, governmental actors, civil society), who are differently exposed to the impacts of deforestation. To betterunderstand this unequal exposure, the paper looks at deforestation from a perspective of environmental justice. As justice is strongly dependent on the local context,we focus on capturing the perceptions of stakeholders on deforestation. We use Q-method, which combines qualitative and quantitative methods to study per-ceptions. Our results point to the existence of three significant perspectives. The first one, labelled ?Development? perspective ranks distribution as the mostimportant dimension. The second one labelled ?Family agriculture? perspective stresses the significance of procedural issues. The third one labelled ?Subsistence?perspective elaborates mainly on matters of recognition.

"1116";"Mapping the Sensitivity of Population Exposure to Changes in Flood Magnitude: Prospective Application From Local to Global Scale";"Andreas Paul Zischg and Mar{'i";"The floodplains of rivers are relevant living spaces for population globally and provide favorable locations for economic development. However, these areas are commonly exposed to floods, and the increasing population together with the changes in storminess as a result of global warming mean that the risks from flooding are expected to rise. Most studies investigating the impact that climatic change has on flood risk are based on a cascade of global climate model simulations coupled with regional climate models, hydrologic models, inundation models, and flood impact models. However, this approach is subject to uncertainties. Model results are found to be sensitive to climate forcing, the structure of the underlying models, the choice of methods used for downscaling and bias correction, and the use of extreme value analysis for both current and future climate conditions. Moreover, uncertainties are expected to propagate through the model cascade. To overcome these problems, we propose a method for analyzing and mapping the sensitivity of population exposure in floodplains to changes in flood magnitude. The method is based on downward counterfactuals, namely perturbations of a selected flood scenario by increasing its magnitude, interpreted in this case as the worsening of a today?s design flood event as a result of climatic changes. The increase in the impact of a current design flood compared to its counterfactual illustrates the sensitivity to changes in hazard. We calculate the normalized gradients of the flood exposure curves, that is, the increase in the exposure and magnitude of the perturbed event relative to the exposure and magnitude of the current scenario. We test the applicability of the method on local, national, and global scale by using existing data sets, including flood hazard maps, flood protection standards, floodplain delineation, river network definition, and spatial population distribution. The gradients were found to vary remarkably across the globe and are overall smaller in the upper range of flood magnitudes that in the lower range. Based on these results, we compare the drivers of the sensitivity in different parts of the world and identify river reaches with the highest relative gradients. These river reaches might be the most affected by climate change and thus deserve an in-depth investigation of the underlying characteristics of the floodplains and the need for climate change adaptation.";2020;"floodplain, risk, sensitivity, population, climate"

While causes for underinsurance have been widely researched, changes to Australian building regulations in the last decade has established a new source of insurance miscalculations. Bushfire Attack Level (BAL) ratings can inflate rebuilding costs by 20% or more, yet BAL ratings remain obfuscated to homeowners and are notoriously confusing to navigate. After the October 2013 bushfires in New South Wales, the Blue Mountains Local Recovery Steering Group found that ?information on the BAL process, the guidelines, the expected costs, the consulting experts and a property?s bushfire-prone status is literally all over the place?. This paper aims to provide clarity on the subject, tracing the precise socio-technical means through which disaster risk is perceived and assessed. The paper conceptualises insurance and risk ratings as calculative devices that provide both a technical solution to reduce financial losses and a philosophical tool for risk rationalisation. It then builds on interviews conducted with residents in the Blue Mountains affected by the 2013 bushfires, to ascertain how such calculative devices practically affect communities at risk. The paper concludes by outlining potential solutions to a confusing and costly problem in Australia, highlighting critical public awareness issues surround BAL ratings, which have profound insurance and wellbeing implications for people rebuilding and recovering from bushfire.";2020;"insurance, underinsurance, bushfire attack level (BAL), risk, community"

In this paper, I focus on DITIB, a Turkish umbrella mosque organization in Germany, and I carry these debates into a transnational terrain, re-theorizing mosques not only as political sites, but also everyday geopolitical spaces where national imaginaries and territorial struggles take place in the daily lives of mosque communities. Through this approach, I draw on the studies of feminist geographers who have provided a renewed perspective to classical geopolitics discussions by revealing how geopolitical relations, struggles, and interactions also operate in everyday spaces, relations, and bodies of ordinary people by reproducing the deep-seated exclusions, discriminations and contestations. This paper contributes to critical geopolitics and geographies of religion literatures as well as to broader discussions on the geopolitics of religion by analysing how a mosque organization is situated at the centre of geopolitical tensions, and how transnational and transregional controversies operate on the walls and properties of mosques and in everyday social/cultural activities of mosque communities.";2020;"mosques, politics, geographies, muslim, tensions"

The spatial drought patterns of the two types are distinct. It has been suggested that they are related to different circulation characteristics, but a lack of observation-based data has precluded further studies. In this paper, we analyze multi-annual summer droughts in North America back to 1600 in tree-ring-based drought reconstructions and in a global, monthly three-dimensional reconstruction of the atmosphere. Using cluster analysis of drought indices, we confirm the two main drought types and find a similar catalog of events as previous studies. These two main types of droughts are then analyzed with respect to 2-m temperatures (T2m), sea-level pressure (SLP), and 500-hPa geopotential height (GPH) in boreal summer. 1950s-type droughts are related to a stronger wave train over the Pacific?North American sector than Dust Bowl-type droughts, whereas the latter show the imprint of a poleward-shifted jet and establishment of a Great Plains ridge. The 500-hPa GPH patterns of the two types differ significantly not only over the contiguous United States and Canada but also over the extratropical North Atlantic and the Pacific. Dust Bowl-type droughts are associated with positive GPH anomalies, while 1950s-type droughts exhibit strong negative GPH anomalies. In comparison with 1950s-type droughts, the Dust Bowl-type droughts are characterized by higher sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) in the northern North Atlantic. Results suggest that atmospheric circulation and SST characteristics not only over the Pacific but also over the extratropical North Atlantic affect the spatial pattern of North American droughts.";2019;"southwestern, drought, circulation, temperatures, patterns"
"1122";"Causes of climate change over the historical record";"Gabriele C Hegerl and Stefan Br{\"o";"This review addresses the causes of observed climate variations across the industrial period, from 1750 to present. It focuses on long-term changes, both in response to external forcing and to climate variability in the ocean and atmosphere. A synthesis of results from attribution studies based on palaeoclimatic reconstructions covering the recent few centuries to the 20th century, and instrumental data shows how greenhouse gases began to cause warming since the beginning of industrialization, causing trends that are attributable to greenhouse gases by 1900 in proxy-based temperature reconstructions. Their influence increased over time, dominating recent trends. However, other forcings have caused substantial deviations from this emerging greenhouse warming trend: volcanic eruptions have caused strong cooling following a period of unusually heavy activity, such as in the early 19th century; or warming during periods of low activity, such as in the early-to-mid 20th century. Anthropogenic aerosol forcing most likely masked some global greenhouse warming over the 20th century, especially since the accelerated increase in sulphate aerosol emissions starting around 1950. Based on modelling and attribution studies, aerosol forcing has also influenced regional temperatures, caused long-term changes in monsoons and imprinted on Atlantic variability. Multi-decadal variations in atmospheric modes can also cause long-term climate variability, as apparent for the example of the North Atlantic Oscillation, and have influenced Atlantic ocean variability. Long-term precipitation changes are more difficult to attribute to external forcing due to spatial sparseness of data and noisiness of precipitation changes, but the observed pattern of precipitation response to warming from station data supports climate model simulated changes and with it, predictions. The long-term warming has also led to significant differences in daily variability as, for example, visible in long European station data. Extreme events over the historical record provide valuable samples of possible extreme events and their mechanisms.";2019;"climate, greenhouse, aerosol, variability, long-term"

Knowledge about land change effects on LST in urbanizing African drylands is very limited. We examined LST and vegetation variations in semi-arid Gaborone (Botswana's capital) using MODIS daytime and night-time LST (DNLST), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) between 2000 and 2018. Significant land transitions were identified in the land cover change map using Change Vector Analysis of Landsat-based biophysical indices of vegetation, water and bare soil. Artificial surface and tree-covered areas were net gaining categories, whereas cropland and grassland were net losing categories. Detailed profiling of DNLST trends and breakpoints was conducted in five relatively homogenous sites representing land cover/transitions. Increasing NDVI and DNLST trends found were significant. Per class, LST change at daytime and night-time are as follows: built-up areas (1.8 K, 2.2 K), Gaborone dam (5.7 K, 0.2 K), settlement expansion areas (4.6 K, 2.2 K), and rural settlement (2.0 K, 1.5 K). The cooling effect of irrigation on daytime LST was higher than night-time LST as daytime LST trend as low as ?0.4 K was found in areas of irrigated croplands. Validation with synoptic station temperature data and dam water levels provides empirical evidence that MODIS gave credible DNLST estimates in this urbanizing dryland area. Our results also suggest the role of climate variability in urbanizing drylands alongside land cover change in controlling the LST. Regardless, coupling DNLST and land cover changes can provide useful information for spatial planning of drylands to create smart cities that are resilient to climate change.";2019;"lulc, lst, gaborone, ndvi, drylands"

The assessment of the links between food security and livelihoods is central for overcoming widespread food insecurity. However, assessments remain challenging due to food security?s multidimensionality and the challenge of finding indicators that are comparable and applicable to various contexts. This study addresses this challenge by adapting a food security index (FSI) and uses it to assess the livelihood drivers of food security. The index captures the multi-dimensionality of food security using conventional food security indicators. The assessed indicators include measures of ?food consumption score,? ?household dietary diversity score,? ?coping strategies index,? the ?household food insecurity access scale,? and ?months of adequate household food provisioning.? The study covered 600 randomly selected households representative of three agro-ecological zones located close to large-scale agricultural investment in Mount Kenya region in Kenya. We used linear regression to identify livelihood factors significantly influencing food security. Spearman?s rank-order correlation and student?s T-test demonstrated a strong and significant correlation between the composite FSI index and each classical indicators of food security. Overall, 32% of the households were food secure and 68% were food insecure. Households? ownership of productive hand tools, followed by off-farm income, consumption of own produced food, type of agro-ecological zone, farm income and number of main crops infested by pests had a significant effect on household food security. All these factors, except the number of main crops infested by pests, were found to positively influence household food security. Households in humid agro-ecological zone were less food secure than households in semi-humid and semi-arid zones. Household size, the size of accessible land and households? members? participation to large agricultural investments (as wage workers or sub-contract farmer) were not significantly influencing food security. Households of the Mount Kenya region need alternative off-farm income sources combined with further support to improve sustainable agriculture management with appropriate hand tools.";2019;"food insecurity, livelihoods, food security index, agro-ecological zones, household food security"

On-farm practices and maize yields in Kenya and Malawi";"S{'e";"Reduced tillage, permanent ground cover and crop diversification are the three core pillars of Conservation Agriculture (CA). We assess and compare on-farm effects of different practices related to the three pillars of CA on maize yields under ENSO-driven rainfall variability in Kenya and Malawi. Reduced tillage practices increased yields per hectare by 250 kg on average in Malawi under below-average rainfall conditions and by 700 kg in Kenya under above-average rainfall, but did not have any significant effect on yields under below-average rainfall conditions in Kenya. Ground cover had a positive impact on yields in Malawi (dry conditions) but not in Kenya (both dry and wet conditions), where mixed crop and livestock systems limited this practice. Crop diversification had positive impacts in Kenya (both dry and wet conditions), where maize-legume crop rotation is practiced, but not in Malawi where landholdings are too small to allow rotation. Our findings suggest that isolated CA techniques can have positive effects on yields even after only a few years of practice under variable rainfall conditions. This strengthens empirical evidence supporting the value of CA in resilience building of agricultural systems, and suggests that both full and partial adoption of CA practices should be supported in areas where climate change is leading to more variable rainfall conditions.";2019;"reduced, tillage, ground, cover, crop"

Many rivers and lakes in Switzerland are regulated and flood damage can be mitigated through an optimal management of lake levels and runoff. This requires high-quality forecasts of atmospheric flood precursors extending beyond short-range (forecast days 1?5) predictions. In several places around the world atmospheric rivers or extreme integrated vapor transport (IVT) are causally related to flood events. Also in Switzerland, extreme IVT oriented perpendicular to the main orography heralds extreme flood events. This relationship is exploited in an operational flood warning system on the medium-range (here forecast days 6?10) time scale based on probabilistic medium-range forecasts of IVT and precipitation over Switzerland provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). This entails first a comprehensive probabilistic verification of the direction and magnitude of (extreme) IVT and second the development of compact visualizations for the operational use by hydrologists. Based on 20 years of probabilistic reforecasts, we show that both regular and extreme IVT has a better predictability than precipitation and IVT is predictable out to day 8. As the direction of IVT is of central importance for flood risk in Switzerland, we develop a visualization that summarizes probabilistic information on both the direction and magnitude of the IVT together with users of the product. The result is an operational flood warning system based solely on atmospheric flood precursors to extend flood warning information beyond the range of high-resolution deterministic weather forecasts.";2019;"floods, alpine, forecasting, IVT, switzerland"
"1137";"SPIE Security + Defence. Target and Background Signatures V";"C{'e";"Reduced visibility and adverse cloud cover is a major issue for aviation, road traffic, and military activities. Synoptic meteorological stations and LIDAR measurements are common tools to detect meteorological conditions. However, a low density of meteorological stations and LIDAR measurements may limit a detailed spatial analysis. While geostationary satellite data is a valuable source of information for analyzing the spatio-temporal variability of fog and clouds on a global scale, considerable effort is still required to improve the detection of atmospheric variables on a local scale, especially during the night. In this study we propose to use thermal camera images to (1) improve cloud detection and (2) to study visibility conditions during nighttime. For this purpose, we leverage FLIR A320 and FLIR A655sc Stationary Thermal Imagers installed in the city of Bern, Switzerland. We find that the proposed data provides detailed information about low clouds and the cloud base height that is usually not seen by satellites. However, clouds with a small optical depth such as thin cirrus clouds are difficult to detect as the noise level of the captured thermal images is high. The second part of this study focuses on the detection of structural features. Predefined targets such as roof windows, an antenna, or a small church tower are selected at distances of 140m to 1210m from the camera. We distinguish between active targets (heated targets or targets with insufficient thermal insulation) and passive structural features to analyze the sensor?s visibility range. We have found that a successful detection of some passive structural features highly depends on incident solar radiation. Therefore, the detection of such features is often hindered during the night. On the other hand, active targets can be detected without difficulty during the night due to major differences in temperature between the heated target and its surrounding non-heated objects. We retrieve response values by the cross-correlation of master edge signatures of the targets and the actual edge-detected thermal camera image. These response values are a precise indicator of the atmospheric conditions and allows us to detect restricted visibility conditions.";2019;"visibility, clouds, thermal, detection, analysis"

For Switzerland, daily-resolved spatial information on meteorological parameters is restricted to the period starting from 1961, whereas prior to that local station observations are the only source of daily, long-term weather data. While attempts have been made to reconstruct spatial weather patterns for certain extreme events, the task of creating a continuous spatial weather reconstruction dataset for Switzerland has so far not been addressed. Here, we aim to reconstruct daily, high-resolution precipitation and temperature fields for Switzerland back to 1864 with an analogue resampling method (ARM) using station data and a weather type classification. Analogue reconstructions are post-processed with an ensemble Kalman fitting (EnKF) approach and quantile mapping. Results suggest that the presented methods are suitable for daily precipitation and temperature reconstruction. Evaluation experiments reveal an excellent skill for temperature and a good skill for precipitation. As illustrated on the example of the avalanche winter 1887/88, these weather reconstructions have a great potential for various analyses of past weather and for climate impact modelling.";2019;"weather, spatial, reconstruction, switzerland, temperature"

The cause has often been assumed to be the eruption of Mount Tambora in April 1815, however this link has not, until now, been proven. Here we apply state-of-the-art event attribution methods to quantify the contribution by the eruption and random weather variability to this extreme European summer climate anomaly. By selecting analogue summers that have similar sea-level-pressure patterns to that observed in 1816 from both observations and unperturbed climate model simulations, we show that the circulation state can reproduce the precipitation anomaly without external forcing, but can explain only about a quarter of the anomalously cold conditions. We find that in climate models, including the forcing by the Tambora eruption makes the European cold anomaly up to 100 times more likely, while the precipitation anomaly became 1.5?3 times as likely, attributing a large fraction of the observed anomalies to the volcanic forcing. Our study thus demonstrates how linking regional climate anomalies to large-scale circulation is necessary to quantitatively interpret and attribute post-eruption variability.";2019;"cold, precipitation, circulation, volcanic, anomaly"

This event was associated with a cold front episode following the eastern slope of the Andes-Amazon interface and a cut-off low pressure system (COL) over the Pacific Ocean. Large scale analyses suggest a two-stage mechanism: The first phase consisted of a strong cold surge to the east of the Andes inducing low level blocking of southward moisture transport over the SW Amazon basin due to post-frontal high-pressure up to 500-hPa synchronized to a Rossby wave train. The second stage was initiated by the displacement of 500-hPa anticyclone over the Andes due to a Rossby wave passage and a subsequent increase in north-easterly moisture transport, while another cold front along the eastern Andes provided additional lifting. We analyse an analog event (July 2010) to confirm the influence of these large-scale features on snow formation.   We conduct a mesoscale analysis using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model. For this purpose, we perform a series of high-resolution numerical experiments that include sensitivity studies where we apply orographic and lake Titicaca temperature modifications. We compare our findings to MODIS snow cover estimates and in-situ measurements. The control simulation is able to capture the snow cover spatial distribution and sheds light over several aspects of the snowfall dynamics. In our WRF simulations, daytime snowfall mainly occurs around complex orography whereas nocturnal snowfall is concentrated over the plateau due to a combination of nocturnal winds and complex orography inside the plateau. The sensitivity experiments indicate the importance of the lake and mountain for thermal wind circulation affecting the spatial distribution of snowfall by shifting the position of the convergence zones. The influence of the lake's thermal effect is not evident around the regions surrounding the lake.";2019;"bolivian, altiplano, snowfall, weather, dynamics"

The delays and their statistical interpretations in view of the viscous flow approach are con-sidered a significant contribution to the understanding of the phenomenon of ?pushing out old water? that is still obscured in the hydrology of hillslopes and catchments. Despite the lack of a satisfying explanation for the high numbers of mobile-water turnovers, the fact that the phenomenon of ?pushing out old water? already occurs in soil columns may stimulate its investigation at the soil profile scale.";2019;"bromide, infiltration, delays, viscous, turnover"

However, many available series, including the well-known (Dijon) Burgundy series, are error prone because scholars so far have uncritically drawn the data from 19th century publications instead of going back to the archives. The GHDs from the famous vine region of Beaune (Burgundy) were entirely drawn from the archives and critically cross-checked with narrative evidence. In order to reconstruct temperature, the series was calibrated against the long Paris temperature series comprising the 360 years from 1659 to 2018. The 664-year-long Beaune series from 1354 to 2018 is also significantly correlated with tree-ring and documentary proxy evidence as well as with the central European temperature series (from 1500). The series is clearly subdivided into two parts. From 1354 to 1987 grapes were on average picked from 28 September on, whereby during the last 31-year-long period of rapid warming from 1988 to 2018 harvests began 13-d earlier. Early harvest dates are shown to be accompanied by high pressure over western?central Europe and atmospheric blocking over Denmark. The 33 extremely early harvests comprising the fifth percentile bracket of GHDs are unevenly distributed over time; 21 of them occurred between 1393 and 1719, while this is the case for just 5 years between 1720 and 2002. Since the hot summer of 2003, 8 out of 16 spring?summer periods were outstanding according to the statistics of the last 664 years, no less than 5 among them within the last 8 years. In the Paris temperature measurements since 1659, April-to-July temperature reached the highest value ever in 2018. In sum, the 664-year-long Beaune GHD series demonstrates that outstanding hot and dry years in the past were outliers, while they have become the norm since the transition to rapid warming in 1988.";2019;"grape, harvest, temperature, series, Europe"

The survival odds of hot spells are increased by more than 50% over most of the Northern Hemisphere extratropical land masses when co?occurring with blocks. Dry spell persistence is also strongly increased by colocated blocks over western North America, Europe, and southern Russia, while it is significantly decreased over the western North Atlantic and the western North Pacific.

To assess the potential of autonomous low-cost UAVs for the mapping and monitoring of alpine glaciers, we conducted multiple aerial surveys on the Kanderfirn in the Swiss Alps in 2017 and 2018 using open hardware and software of the Paparazzi UAV project. The open-source photogrammetry software OpenDroneMap was tested for the generation of high-resolution orthophotos and digital surface models (DSMs) from aerial imagery and cross-checked with the well-established proprietary software Pix4D. Accurately measured ground control points served for the determination of the geometric accuracy of the orthophotos and DSMs. A horizontal (xy) accuracy of 0.7?1.2 m and a vertical (z) accuracy of 0.7?2.1 m was achieved for OpenDroneMap, compared to a xy-accuracy of 0.3?0.5 m and a z-accuracy of 0.4?0.5 m obtained for Pix4D. Based on the analysis and comparison of different orthophotos and DSMs, surface elevation, roughness and brightness changes from 3 June to 29 September 2018 were quantified. While the brightness of the glacier surface decreased linearly over the ablation season, the surface roughness increased. The mean DSM-based elevation change across the glacier tongue was 8 m, overestimating the measured melting and surface lowering at the installed ablation stakes by about 1.5 m.

"1162";"Impact of the dry-day definition on Mediterranean extreme dry-spell analysis";"Pauline Marie Cl{'e";"To define a dry day, the most common approach is to identify a fixed threshold below which precipitation is considered equivalent to zero. This fixed threshold is usually set to account for measurement errors and precipitation losses due to the atmospheric evaporation demand. Yet, this threshold could vary in time according to the seasonal cycle and in the context of long-term trends, such as the increase in temperature due to climate change. In this study, we compare extreme dry spells, defined either with a fixed threshold for a dry day (1-mm) or with a time-varying threshold estimated from reference evapotranspiration (ET0), for a large database of 160 rain gauges covering large parts of the Mediterranean basin. Results indicated positive trends in ET0 during summer months (June, July and August) in particular. However, these trends do not imply longer dry spells since the daily precipitation intensities remain higher than the increase in the evaporative demand. Results also indicated a seasonal behavior: in winter the distribution of extreme dry spells is similar when considering a fixed threshold (1-mm) or a time-varying threshold defined with ET0. However, during summer, the extreme dry-spell durations estimated with a 1-mm threshold are strongly underestimated in comparison to extreme dry spells computed with ET0. We stress the need to account for the atmospheric evaporative demand instead of using fixed thresholds for defining a dry day when analyzing dry spells, with respect to agricultural impacts in particular.";2019;"dry, threshold, time-varying, evapotranspiration, mediterranean"
"1163";"Causes of increased flood frequency in central Europe in the 19th century";"Stefan Br{\"o";"Historians and historical climatologists have long pointed to an increased flood frequency in central Europe in the mid- and late 19th century. However, the causes have remained unclear. Here, we investigate the changes in flood frequency in Switzerland based on long time series of discharge and lake levels, precipitation, and weather types and based on climate model simulations, focusing on the warm season. Annual series of peak discharge or maximum lake level, in agreement with previous studies, display increased frequency of floods in the mid-19th century and decreased frequency after the Second World War. Annual series of warm-season mean precipitation and high percentiles of 3-d precipitation totals (partly) reflect these changes. A daily weather type classification since 1763 is used to construct flood probability indices for the catchments of the Rhine in Basel and the outflow of Lake Lugano, Ponte Tresa. The indices indicate an increased frequency of flood-prone weather types in the mid-19th century and a decreased frequency in the post-war period, consistent with a climate reconstruction that shows increased (decreased) cyclonic flow over western Europe in the former (latter) period. To assess the driving factors of the detected circulation changes, we analyze weather types and precipitation in a large ensemble of atmospheric model simulations driven with observed sea-surface temperatures. In the simulations, we do not find an increase in flood-prone weather types in the Rhine catchment in the 19th century but a decrease in the post-war period that could have been related to sea-surface temperature anomalies.";2019;"flood, frequency, climate, precipitation, circulation"

However, various sources of uncertainty arise along the model chains used for the assessment of flood risk under climate change.Knowledge on the importance of these different sources of uncertainty can help to design future assessments of flood risk, and to identify areas of focus for further research that aims to reduce existing uncertainties. Herewe investigate the role of four sources of epistemic uncertainty affecting the estimation of flood loss for changed climate conditions for ameso-scale, pre-alpine catchment. These are: the choice of a scenario-neutralmethod, climate projection uncertainty, hydrological model parameter sets, and the choice of the vulnerability function. To efficiently simulate a large number of loss estimates, a surrogate inundationmodelwas used. 46,500 loss estimateswere selected according to the change in annualmean precipitation and temperature of an ensemble of regional climatemodels, and considered for the attribution of uncertainty. Large uncertainty was found in the estimated loss for a 100-year flood event with losses ranging from a decrease of loss compared to estimations for present day climate, to more than a 7-fold increase. The choice of the vulnerability function was identified as the most important source of uncertainty explaining almost half of the variance in the estimates. However, uncertainty related to estimating floods for changed climate conditions contributed nearly as much. Hydrologicalmodel parametrisation was found to be negligible in the present setup. For our study area, these results highlight the importance of improving vulnerability function formulation even in a climate change context where additional major sources of uncertainty arise.";2019;"risk,uncertainty,climate,model,vulnerability"

LSLA are expected to lead to the conversion of some kinds of resources (land, water, biodiversity, wind ) into others (high-value crops, monetary resources or Infrastructures ). While some commons disappear (pastures, forests, hunting grounds) other are created through CSR measures (Infrastructure, Irrigation channels, special community funds, classrooms or dispensaries). This paper explores the nexus between LSLA, anti-politics and CSR. Focusing on the public and private actors involved in - or impacted by - LSLA, we recount the drama of the grabbed commons. Combining approaches of New Institutionalism and Political Ecology, we ask: how is the access to resources impacted by the dissolution of existing commons, recognizing that many dimensions or power operate in an investment project, including gender, migration background, social status, age and lineage? Do new commons created by LSLA compensate for the loss of old commons? If the new commons do not compensate for the loss of old commons, why are people not raising their voices to preserve them? Our empirical evidence from detailed case studies in Ghana, Malawi, Morocco, and Tanzania shows that, under the promise of development, a growing number of land users are deprived from access to commons; at the same time local to global elites are Increasingly interested in assuring high returns of capital investment.

"1170";"AtmoSwing: Analog Technique Model for Statistical Weather forecastING and downscalING (v2.1.0)";"Pascal Horton";"Analog methods (AMs) use synoptic-scale predictors to search in the past for similar days to a target day in order to infer the predictand of interest, such as daily precipitation. They can rely on outputs of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in the context of operational forecasting or outputs of climate models in the context of climate impact studies. AMs require low computing capacity and have demonstrated useful potential for application in several contexts.  AtmoSwing is open-source software written in C++ that implements AMs in a flexible way so that different variants can be handled dynamically. It comprises four tools: a Forecaster for use in operational forecasting, a Viewer to display the results, a Downscaler for climate studies, and an Optimizer to establish the relationship between predictands and predictors.  The Forecaster handles every required processing internally, such as NWP output downloading (when possible) and reading as well as grid interpolation, without external scripts or file conversion. The processing of a forecast requires low computing efforts and can even run on a Raspberry Pi computer. It provides valuable results, as revealed by a 3-year-long operational forecast in the Swiss Alps.  The Viewer displays the forecasts in an interactive GIS environment with several levels of synthesis and detail. This allows for the provision of a quick overview of the potential critical situations in the upcoming days, as well as the possibility for the user to delve into the details of the forecasted predictand and criteria distributions.  The Downscaler allows for the use of AMs in a climatic context, either for climate reconstruction or for climate change impact studies. When used for future climate studies, it is necessary to pay close attention to the selected predictors so that they contain the climate change signal.  The Optimizer implements different optimization techniques, such as a semiautomatic sequential approach, Monte Carlo simulations, and a global optimization technique, using genetic algorithms. Establishing a statistical relationship between predictors and predictands is computationally intensive because it requires numerous assessments over decades. To this end, the code was highly optimized for computing efficiency, is parallelized (using multiple threads), and scales well on a Linux cluster. This procedure is only required to establish the statistical relationship, which can then be used for forecasting or downscaling at a low computing cost.";2019;"analog, methods, software, forecasting, optimization"
"1171";"Social Acceptance of a Multi-Purpose Reservoir in a Recently Deglaciated Landscape in the Swiss Alps";"Elke Kellner";"Climate change impacts such as shrinking glaciers and decreasing snow cover are expected to cause changes in the water balance throughout the 21st century. New proglacial lakes in recently deglaciated areas could be used for mitigation measures such as hydropower production and adaptation measures to temporarily retain water and transfer it seasonally to compensate for seasonal water scarcity. Such multipurpose reservoirs could counterbalance the water currently provided by glaciers and the seasonal snowpack. However, new dam projects often face various conflicts due to their impact on nature, biodiversity, and the landscape. This article presents the determinants for social acceptance of the first reservoir in a recently deglaciated landscape in the Swiss Alps. Three main determinants were identified: (1) the forthcoming popular vote on the national Swiss Energy Strategy 2050; (2) the participatory process, which contains a polycentric design; and (3) the project area, which does not yet have protected status. The three determinants facilitate social acceptance of the dam project, but lead to less attention on using the stored water for multiple services. These findings have implications on sustainable development, because dams in recently deglaciated areas support the transition to renewable energy sources, but transform a natural resource system into a hydroelectric landscape.";2019;"climate, water, lakes, acceptance, dams"

However, it remains unclear how different governance processes can coordinate competing resource uses despite incoherence of institutional resource regimes. This paper examines how institutional resource regimes and polycentric governance processes are co-evolving and to what extent these processes coordinate competing resource uses in incoherent resource regimes. Empirically, we performed an embedded case study of the institutional resource regime and governance processes of three water reservoir projects with contrasting outcomes in the region of Oberhasli in the canton of Berne, Switzerland, covering a timeframe starting from the early 20th century. Data were collected through 21 semi-structured interviews, document analysis, participatory observation, and transect walks. Analytically, we demonstrate how the combination of the Institutional Resource Regime and polycentric governance frameworks provides an opportunity to analyze co-evolving resource regimes and governance processes. The results show that the institutional resource regime has become increasingly incoherent over the past decades, but the evolution of polycentric processes to govern competing water uses compensated for regime incoherence. Polycentric governance improved the coordination of water uses, if mutual adjustment, trust and activation of overarching rules between actors with similar and opposing interests were present. We conclude that institutional regime incoherence may constitute a critical barrier to climate change adaptation, but polycentric governance processes may alleviate critical challenges arising from regime incoherence.";2019;"incoherent, institutional, governance, resource, polycentric"

The Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) Project is an effort to fill this need. It is supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES), and the Department of Energy (DOE), and is facilitated by collaboration with the international Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth initiative. 20CR is the first ensemble of sub-daily global atmospheric conditions spanning over 100 years. This provides a best estimate of the weather at any given place and time as well as an estimate of its confidence and uncertainty. While extremely useful, version 2c of this dataset (20CRv2c) has several significant issues, including inaccurate estimates of confidence and a global sea level pressure bias in the mid-19th century. These and other issues can reduce the effectiveness of studies at many spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, the 20CR system underwent a series of developments to generate a significant new version of the reanalysis. The version 3 system (NOAA-CIRES-DOE 20CRv3) uses upgraded data assimilation methods including an adaptive inflation algorithm; has a newer, higher-resolution forecast model that specifies dry air mass; and assimilates a larger set of pressure observations. These changes have improved the ensemble-based estimates of confidence, removed spin-up effects in the precipitation fields, and diminished the sea level pressure bias. Other improvements include more accurate representations of storm intensity, smaller errors, and large-scale reductions in model bias. The 20CRv3 system is comprehensively reviewed, focusing on the aspects that have ameliorated issues in 20CRv2c. Despite the many improvements, some challenges remain, including a systematic bias in tropical precipitation and time-varying biases in southern high latitude pressure fields.";2019;"historical, reanalysis, ensemble, confidence, improvements"

Lightning data from 2001 to 2014 were used to identify thunderstorm days and blocking events were extracted from the ERA?Interim reanalysis using an objective identification algorithm. The statistical link between the two phenomena is established through odds ratio analysis. Two areas ? one over the eastern part of the North Atlantic and one over the Baltic Sea ? were identified as locations where blocking influences the occurrence of deep moist convection in parts of western and central Europe. Based on the mean ambient conditions on days with blocking in these two areas, well?known dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms supporting or suppressing the development of thunderstorms were confirmed. The anticyclonic circulation of a block over the eastern part of the North Atlantic leads to a northerly to northwesterly advection of dry and stable air masses into Europe on the eastern flank of the block. In addition, these environmental conditions are on average associated with large?scale subsidence of air masses (convection?inhibiting conditions). In contrast, the southerly to southwesterly advection of warm, moist and unstable air masses on the western flank of a block over the Baltic Sea results in convection?favouring conditions over western and central Europe. Both blocking situations are on average associated with weak wind speeds at mid?tropospheric levels and with weak wind shear. As a consequence, thunderstorms related to atmospheric blocking over the Baltic Sea tend to be on average less organised.";2019;"atmospheric blocking, thunderstorm activity, north atlantic, europe, odds ratio"

Until recently, the lack of integrative studies using archaeological, palaeoecological and palaeoclimatological data prevented an evaluation of the relationship between climate change, distinct subsistence strategies and cultural transformations across the largest rainforest of the world, Amazonia. Here we review the most relevant cultural changes seen in the archaeological record of six different regions within Greater Amazonia during late pre-Columbian times. We compare the chronology of those cultural transitions with high-resolution regional palaeoclimate proxies, showing that, while some societies faced major reorganization during periods of climate change, others were unaffected and even flourished. We propose that societies with intensive, specialized land-use systems were vulnerable to transient climate change. In contrast, land-use systems that relied primarily on polyculture agroforestry, resulting in the formation of enriched forests and fertile Amazonian dark earth in the long term, were more resilient to climate change.";2019;"ancient, societies, climate, change, Amazonia"

While the most recent generation of ESMs simulates runoff per land surface grid cell operationally, it does not typically simulate river streamflow directly. Here, we apply the model output statistics (MOS) method to the hindcast archive of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). Linear models are tested that regress observed river streamflow on surface runoff, subsurface runoff, total runoff, precipitation, and surface air temperature simulated by ECMWF's forecast systems S4 and SEAS5. In addition, the pool of candidate predictors contains observed precipitation and surface air temperature preceding the date of prediction. The experiment is conducted for 16 European catchments in the period 1981-2006 and focuses on monthly average streamflow at lead times of 0 and 20 days. The results show that skill against the streamflow climatology is frequently absent and varies considerably between predictor combinations, catchments, and seasons. Using streamflow persistence as a benchmark model further deteriorates skill. This is most pronounced for a catchment that features lakes, which extend to about 14% of the catchment area.

Nine classes of hydrocarbon surfactants were detected in AFFFs including octylphenol polyethoxylates, linear alcohol ethoxylates, ethoxylated cocoamines, alkyl ether sulfates, alkyl amido dipropionates, linear alkyl benzenesulfonates, alkyl sulfates, and polyethylene glycols. Of those, six were also found in groundwater along with diethanolamines and alkyl amido betaines, which were not found in the eight archived AFFFs.

This paper unveils the gender dynamics in resource access, use and labour control to show how outgrower CF induces changes, often contradictory engendering processes of production relations. It asks: How does CF influence gender relations in access to land, household labour relations and employment conditions (participation)? Relying on a detailed case study research of a sugarcane CF scheme in Malawi, we show that CF has a complex gendered impact on household?s production relations. CF leads to a masculinization of farm management and ownership together with a feminization of labour. Nevertheless, women translate such labour provision into active participation in decision-making over the use of the cash returns from the CF for better outcome in the household. At the individual level, some can benefit from it; especially women who manage to engage in cane farming are able to attain financial independence and increase their bargaining power within their households. However, such benefits are reserved for households with access to land. Nevertheless, women engagement in cane farming coupled with increased gender awareness through NGOs sensitization is contributing to a change in gendered social perceptions and increased valuation of women abilities in commercial farming, their needs and contributions and may be modifying the gender balance at the community level. We demonstrate that empowering women by making them cane farmers alone is not enough to change women position within their communities, unless community members accompany such empowerment with the recognition and acknowledgement of the women?s contribution. The finding suggests that combining active women participation in outgrower CF with authority enhancing programs through community education whilst creating the possibilities for women to take independent action may be a good way to improve the gender relations between men and women.";2019;"contract, farming, gender, dynamics, households"

The method is applied to precipitation extremes over the upper Aare catchment, an area in Switzerland which is characterized by complex terrain. The statistical downscaling part consists of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) framework trained in a reference period. Thereby, dynamically downscaled precipitation over the target area serve as predictands and large-scale variables, received from the global model simulation, as predictors. Applying the ANN to long term global simulations produces a precipitation series that acts as a surrogate of the dynamically downscaled precipitation for a longer climate period, and therefore are used in the selection of events. These events are then dynamically downscaled with a regional climate model to 2 km. The results show that this strategy is suitable to constraint extreme precipitation events, although some limitations remain, e.g., the method has lower efficiency in identifying extreme events in summer and the sensitivity of extreme events to climate change is underestimated.";2019;"dynamical, downscaling, extreme, events, precipitation"

Despite their importance, there has been no global assessment of threats to MtSES, even as they face unprecedented challenges to their sustainability. With survey data from 57 MtSES sites worldwide, we test a conceptual model of the types and scales of stressors and ecosystem services in MtSES and explore their distinct configurations according to their primary economic orientation and  land use. We find that MtSES worldwide are experiencing both gradual and abrupt climatic, economic, and governance changes, with policies made by outsiders as the most ubiquitous challenge. Mountains that support primarily subsistence?oriented livelihoods, especially agropastoral systems, deliver abundant services but are also most at risk. Moreover, transitions from subsistence? to market?oriented economies are often accompanied by increased physical connectedness, reduced diversity of cross?scale ecosystem services, lowered importance of local knowledge, and shifting vulnerabilities to threats. Addressing the complex challenges facing MtSES and catalyzing transformations to MtSES sustainability  will require cross?scale partnerships among researchers, stakeholders, and decision makers to jointly identify desired futures and adaptation pathways, assess trade?offs in prioritizing ecosystem services, and share best practices for sustainability. These transdisciplinary approaches will allow local stakeholders, researchers, and practitioners to jointly address  MtSES knowledge gaps while simultaneously focusing on critical issues of poverty and food security.";2019;"mountain, social, ecological, threats, sustainability, partnerships"

Several well-established methods exist for estimating low-probability floods. However, a global assessment of the consistency of these methods is difficult to achieve because the ?true value? of an extreme flood is not observable. A detailed comparison performed on a given case study brings useful information about the statistical and hydrological processes involved in different methods. In the present study, the following three methods of estimating low-probability floods are compared: a purely statistical method (ordinary extreme value statistics), a statistical method based on stochastic rainfall-runoff simulation (SCHADEX method), and a deterministic method (physically based estimation of the probable maximum flood, PMF). These methods are tested for two different Swiss catchments; the results show that the 10,000-year return level flood estimations exceed the PMF estimations by 3% and 18%. The analysis shows that the plausibility of an extreme flood estimation does not only depend on the applied method but also on its ability to represent flood-triggering processes, including precipitation input, spatio-temporal precipitation distribution, and runoff.";2019;"flood, estimation, methods, comparison, swiss"

We use James Ferguson?s Anti-Politics Machine to critically interrogate the development discourses used to promote LSLA. LSLA are expected to lead to the conversion of some kinds of resources (land, water, biodiversity, wind?) into others (high-value crops, monetary resources or infrastructures?). While some commons disappear (pastures, forests, hunting grounds?) other are created through CSR measures (infrastructure, irrigation channels, special community funds, classrooms or dispensaries). This paper explores the nexus between LSLA, anti-politics and CSR. Focusing on the public and private actors involved in ? or impacted by ? LSLA, we recount the drama of the grabbed commons. Combining approaches of New Institutionalism and Political Ecology, we ask: how is the access to resources impacted by the dissolution of existing commons, recognizing that many dimensions of power operate in an investment project, including gender, migration background, social status, age and lineage? Do new commons created by LSLA compensate for the loss of old commons? If the new commons do not compensate for the loss of old commons, why are people not raising their voices to preserve them? Our empirical evidence from detailed case studies in Ghana, Malawi, Morocco, and Tanzania shows that, under the promise of development, a growing number of land users are deprived from access to commons; at the same time local to global elites are increasingly interested in assuring high returns of capital investment.

While LDN offers an approach to monitor land degradation, through net-gain in land cover, land productivity and soil organic carbon, its operationalisation poses methodological, implementation and governance challenges. Based on a review of literature, available spatial datasets and the analysis of national policies, we examine the dynamics of land degradation and the prospects of LDN in Nigeria. We identify land pollution and gully erosion as further relevant indicators for LDN in the Nigerian context. We found that current institutional arrangements are largely unconducive and incoherent for operationalising LDN. Despite Nigeria?s international commitments, current national policies with relevance to LDN are vague and fragmented, based on several old laws, and have important gaps for monitoring due to inadequate data, skills and expertise, inadequate coordination, and the lack of national LDN baselines. The limited power of the national environmental agency and the lack of political will to change this situation compound the challenges. However, two promising entry points for operationalising LDN include incentivising and monitoring Sustainable Land Management practices (SLM) of local resource users according to agro-ecological zones, and mainstreaming SLM into initiatives in its agriculture and environment sectors. These insights can inform the operationalisation of LDN in other African countries.";2019;"land, degradation, neutrality, nigeria, operationalisation"

Yet, factors influencing loss, i.e. vulnerability, have gained less attention to date. Vulnerability is defined as the degree of loss resulting from the hazard impact on buildings. Recent studies have focused on evaluating vulnerability to dynamic flooding using proxies from case studies and based on empirical ex-post approaches. However, the transferability to other case studies and, therefore, the ability of such models to actually predict future losses is limited. To overcome this gap, we present a beta model based on loss data from the European Alps, which clearly shows that a single vulnerability function is sufficient to predict losses resulting from different types of torrential hazards and to provide probabilities of destruction under specific scenarios. As a result, the curves are transferable and may significantly increase the predictive power of risk analyses.";2019;"climate, hazard, vulnerability, loss, predictive"

However, a growing body of work shows that innovation also occurs in peripheral regions and small towns. Furthermore, work on rural social networks shows that diversity is multidimensional, and that along certain dimensions networks developed in rural areas are more diverse than those observed in cities. In this paper, we develop these arguments, then report our observations of seven successful firms in Swiss small towns. These firms benefit from at least three types of diversity: internal diversity; multiplexed interactions between workers at different hierarchical levels; and external diversity as firms reach beyond the region.

Winkler and Chinwe Ifejika Speranza";"Flooding disasters in urban and suburban Dakar have been prioritised in various policy actions over the last two decades. Our research aimed to generate a historical overview of the progressive transformations of flood governance in Dakar. We found that flood governance policies have gone through three main phases, each representing a paradigm shift: the ?emergency-relief? phase, the ?water-pull-out? phase, and the ?live-with-water? phase. We argue that the second phase, which began in 2012, was supported by an engineering approach, where fresh water was literally pulled out using large-scale drainage infrastructure. This can be considered the ultimate stage of the conquest of urbanisation over nature. The resulting situation was a clear reduction in flood exposure, giving rise to smaller disasters. A new form of land competition also developed in the areas that were drained of water. These areas required the inclusion of local stakeholders into flood management processes. Although both the government and international partners have invested efforts in trying to coordinate flood management, the distribution of competences across several ministries and a lack of cooperation is provoking a ?vertically divided authority?, leading to overlapping mandates and competition among state and non-state agencies. From 2014 onwards, what we called the ?live-with-water? phase supported the greater inclusion of local stakeholders and a change in articulation, which tried to consider water not as a threat but as a resource. The conclusion of this paper calls for the development of locally centred flood management bodies (including grass-root organisations and municipalities) as well as a more elaborate and complex articulation of the physical and institutional temporalities and scales of flood management.";2019;"flooding, governance, phases, urbanisation, stakeholders"

Based on field description, particle size distribution, mineralogy (heavy minerals and clay minerals) as well as geochemistry we track the signal of both materials (local basalt-derived and loess-derived), estimate the maximum thickness of loess mantles and mixed zones (having both loess and basaltic components), and note the presence or absence of basal layers without allochtonous additions. The results show that geochemistry and heavy minerals are the most reliable proxies for a verification of aeolian silt contributions and to define individual layers in complex soil parent materials.  Soil formation in the studied landscape depends on the type of slope sediments. Typical fine-grained weathering of basalt without input from aeolian silt would promote rather vertic development. However, in thick loess deposits as well as in thin silt-textured materials superimposed on clay loam beds, clay illuviation dominates. Development of argic horizons, however, results in decreasing permeability, promoting water stagnation and enhanced degradation processes in clay-rich subsoil. Instead of Luvisols, Stagnosols and Retisols developed in the study regions. Basaltic block covers mixed with loess host cambic horizons. Based on our findings it seems that at the edge of thin loess deposits no soils exist that developed exclusively from basaltic parent materials.";2019;"inheritance, geochemistry, loess, basalt, soil"

The Zn fluxes at three grassland sites in Switzerland were determined by a detailed analysis of relevant inputs (atmospheric deposition, manure, weathering) and outputs (seepage water, biomass harvest) during one hydrological year. The most important Zn input occurred through animal manure (1,076 to 1,857 g ha-1 yr-1) and Zn mass balances revealed net Zn accumulations (456 to 1,478 g ha-1 yr-1). We used Zn stable isotopes to assess the importance of anthropogenic impacts and natural long-term processes on the Zn distribution in soils. Soil-plant cycling and parent material weathering were identified as the most important processes, over the entire period of soil formation (13,700 years), while the soil pH strongly affected the direction of Zn isotopic fractionation. Recent anthropogenic inputs of Zn only had a smaller influence compared to the natural processes of the past 13,700 years.

The key challenges of the approach are the choice of the meteorological variables and statistics thereof and how to generate time series representing altered climatologies of the selected variables. Different methods have been proposed to achieve this, and it remains unclear if and to which extent they result in comparable flood change projections. Here, we compare projections of annual maximum floods (AMFs) derived from three different scenario-neutral methods for a prealpine study catchment. The methods chosen use different types of meteorological data, namely, observations, regional climate model output, and weather generator data. The different time series account for projected changes in the seasonality of temperature and precipitation, in the occurrence statistics of precipitation, and of daily precipitation extremes. Resulting change in mean AMF peak magnitudes and volumes differs in sign between the methods (range of ?6% to +7% for flood peak magnitudes and ?11% to +14% for flood volumes). Moreover, variability of projected peak magnitudes and flood volumes depends on method with one approach leading to a generally larger spread. The differences between the methods vary depending on whether peak magnitudes or flood volumes are considered and different relationships between peak magnitude and volume change result. These findings can be linked to differing flood regime changes among the three approaches. The study highlights that considering selected aspects of climate change only when performing scenario-neutral studies may lead to differing representations of flood generating processes by the approaches and thus different quantifications of flood change. As each method comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, it is recommended to combine several scenario-neutral approaches to obtain more robust results.";2019;"climate, floods, methods, change, projections"

The response is evaluated based on time-lagged composites for 146 recurving TCs between 1979 and 2013 and quantified by the area affected by precipitation extremes (PEA) in a domain shifted relative to the TC?jet interaction location, which often encompasses major parts of Europe. The statistical significance of the PEA response to the TCs is determined using a novel bootstrapping technique based on flow analogs. A statistically significant increase in PEA is found between lags +42 and +90 h after the TC?jet interaction, with a doubling of the PEA compared to analog cases without recurving TCs. A K-means clustering applied to the natural logarithm of potential vorticity fields [ln(PV)] around the TC?jet interaction points reveals four main flow configurations of North Atlantic TC?jet interactions. Two main mechanisms by which recurving TCs can foster precipitation extremes farther downstream emerge: 1) an ?atmospheric river?like? mechanism, with anomalously high integrated vapor transport (IVT) downstream of the recurving TCs and 2) a ?downstream-development? mechanism, with anomalously high IVT ahead of a downstream trough. Hereby, the analog bootstrapping technique separates the impact of the TC from that of the midlatitude flow?s natural evolution on the PEA formation. This analysis reveals an unequivocal effect of the TCs for the atmospheric river?like cases, while for the downstream-development cases, a substantial increase in PEA is also found in the analogs without a TC.";2019;"climatological, tropical, downstream, precipitation, extreme"

One of the foundational papers in extratropical cyclone structure by Jakob Bjerknes was published in 1919, leading to what is now known as the Norwegian cyclone model. Also that year, a series of meetings was held that led to the formation of organizations that promoted the international collaboration and scientific exchange required for extratropical cyclone research, which by necessity involves spatial scales spanning national borders. This chapter describes the history of scientific inquiry into the structure, evolution, and dynamics of extratropical cyclones, their constituent fronts, and their attendant jet streams and storm tracks. We refer to these phenomena collectively as the centerpiece of meteorology because of their central role in fostering meteorological research during this century. This extremely productive period in extratropical cyclone research has been possible because of 1) the need to address practical challenges of poor forecasts that had large socioeconomic consequences, 2) the intermingling of theory, observations, and diagnosis (including dynamical modeling) to provide improved physical understanding and conceptual models, and 3) strong international cooperation. Conceptual frameworks for cyclones arise from a desire to classify and understand cyclones; they include the Norwegian cyclone model and its sister the Shapiro?Keyser cyclone model. The challenge of understanding the dynamics of cyclones led to such theoretical frameworks as quasigeostrophy, baroclinic instability, semigeostrophy, and frontogenesis. The challenge of predicting explosive extratropical cyclones in particular led to new theoretical developments such as potential-vorticity thinking and downstream development. Deeper appreciation of the limits of predictability has resulted from an evolution from determinism to chaos.

Following previous studies describing the block?s predictability, the present study aims to investigate uncertainties in the upper-level wave pattern and diabatic processes that were responsible for the block?s forecast variability during its onset, mature, and decay phases. With this aim, an ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA) is performed for three medium-range THORPEX Interactive Grand Global Ensemble multimodel ensemble forecasts, one associated with each phase of the block?s life cycle. The ESA revealed that the block?s predictability was influenced by forecast uncertainties in the general wave pattern and in the vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT), used here as a proxy for diabatic processes. These uncertainties are associated with spatial shifts and intensity changes of synoptic waves and IVT during the whole life cycle of the block. During the onset phase, specific features include an Atlantic precursor block and the occurrence of several cyclones. During the mature stage, the blocking ridge itself was highly predictable, while forecast uncertainties in the wave pattern and in IVT primarily were associated with uncertainties in the block?s western flank. During the decay phase, the ESA signals were less intense, but the forecast variability significantly depended on the transformation of the block into a high-over-low pattern. It can be concluded that ESA is suitable to investigate the block?s forecast variability in multimodel ensembles.";2019;"atmospheric, predictability, uncertainties, diabatic, ensemble"

Consequently, patients with KRAS-driven tumors are routinely treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, which is often transiently effective owing to development of drug resistance. In this study, we show that hyperactivated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a characteristic hallmark of KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma after chemotherapy treatment, and that KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells rely on persistent mTOR signaling to resist chemotherapeutic drugs. Coherently, mTOR inhibition circumvents the refractory phenotype and restores sensitivity of resistant KRAS-mutant lung cancer cells to chemotherapy. Importantly, drug combinations of clinically approved mTOR inhibitors and chemotherapy drugs synergize in inhibiting cell proliferation of KRAS-mutant cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, and the efficacy of this combination treatment correlates with the magnitude of mTOR activity induced by chemotherapy alone. These results pinpoint mTOR as a mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy in KRAS-mutant lung cancer and validate a rational and readily translatable strategy that combines mTOR inhibitors with standard chemotherapy to treat KRAS-mutant adenocarcinoma, the most common and deadliest lung cancer subset.";2019;"kras, mtor, chemotherapy, resistance, inhibitor"

This systematic review aims to identify the research gaps and future direction of soil carbon management in Australia. We explored and synthesized the use of social-ecological systems (SES) both in the global and Australian context, before making the first attempt to develop a conceptual SES framework for soil carbon management. Both quantitative and qualitative assessment of articles were used to identify and synthesise research trends, challenges and opportunities for improved soil carbon management. The results provide valuable insight into the SES components examined, the research gaps and the methodological challenges for research into soil carbon management conducted over the last two decades. The review revealed that research has predominately focused on the ecological component of soil carbon management in agricultural practices and has been conducted from a scientist?s perspective. The sustainability of carbon-building soil management practices will require integration of social components into future research, particularly from a farmer perspective. The proposed conceptual SES framework is designed to identify and investigate SES components in soil carbon management in order to increase the process of offsetting greenhouse gas emissions as required by Sustainable Development Goals 2, 13 and 15.";2019;"research, soil, carbon, management, social-ecological"

The concept of ?telecoupling? provides a framework for analysis of distant actors and institutions that influence local land use decisions. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the extent of telecoupling of land governance in north-eastern Madagascar and a lack of evidence regarding its role in driving land use change and land competition. Using a descriptive Social Network Analysis, we disentangled distant interactions between actors in terms of flows and institutions. Our findings show that the domains of economic and environmental interactions are dominated by actors from different sectors that have claims on the same land but generally do not interact. Distant influences occurring via remote flows of goods, money, and institutions serve to reinforce local land competition. Balancing economic and environmental land claims for more sustainable regional development in north-eastern Madagascar requires collaboration between actors across sectors, scales, and domains.";2019;"biodiversity, telecoupling, governance, analysis, collaboration"

The procedure involved a public consultation through online media, followed by two workshops through which a large number of potential science questions were collated, prioritised, and synthesised. In spite of the diversity of the participants (230 scientists in total), the process revealed much about community priorities and the state of our science: a preference for continuity in research questions rather than radical departures or redirections from past and current work. Questions remain focused on the process-based understanding of hydrological variability and causality at all space and time scales. Increased attention to environmental change drives a new emphasis on understanding how change propagates across interfaces within the hydrological system and across disciplinary boundaries. In particular, the expansion of the human footprint raises a new set of questions related to human interactions with nature and water cycle feedbacks in the context of complex water management problems. We hope that this reflection and synthesis of the 23 unsolved problems in hydrology will help guide research efforts for some years to come.";2019;"hydrology, research, questions, variability, environment"

The dataset includes a total of 35,364 daily series of maximum and minimum temperature obtained from seven different collections. About 97% of the series  are  publicly  available  in  a  common  format,  while  the  remaining  3%  can  be  obtained from the original data providers. Unlike other similar products, duplicates have been removed without blending of series, which simplifies data traceability and improves the temporal homogeneity of the individual series at the cost of a smaller average length. Residual artificial signals (breakpoints) in the series caused by sta-tion  relocations,  changes  in  instrumentation,  etc.,  have  been  detected  by  means  of  the combination of four breakpoint detection tests, four variables and three temporal aggregations. The combined results give not only the most probable position of the breakpoints,  but  also  a  measure  of  their  likelihood.  The  reliability  of  the  detection  was estimated for each year of each target series, based on the number of reference series  and  on  their  correlation  with  the  target  series.  Moreover,  its  general  perfor-mance was evaluated through a benchmark of synthetic series.

Previously available data from stations in Northern Italy have been extended considerably by recent digitization work, and, for the first time, they have been combined with daily data from Swiss stations on a centennial scale. Precipitation frequency in the southern Alps decreased significantly over the period 1890?2017. We show that this trend is related to a step-like reduction in cyclonic weather types over central Europe that occurred around 1940. This decrease is an example of the large variability that affects precipitation in the region over many different time  cales. In particular, strong trends on a decadal scale are related to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, although the influence of the latter is present only in the recent decades. Trends in heavy precipitation indices do not show a coherent pattern across the study area. We find a significant increase in heavy precipitation in Switzerland, while a decrease affects the southeastern subset in spring.";2019;"alps, precipitation, trends, cyclonic, variability"

"1258";"Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Climate Science";"Stefan Br{\"o";"The free troposphere is the location of important weather and climate processes. Here, horizontal and vertical transport of energy, mass and momentum take place and it holds greenhouse gases, water vapour and clouds. The free troposphere therefore plays an important role in global climate feedback processes. Mountains provide important ecosystem services for a large lowland population. Mountain ecosystems might react particularly strongly to climatic changes. This is because mountains intersect important environmental and geoecological boundaries such as the snow line and the tree line. In a changing climate, these boundaries may shift. Climate change thus affects mountain glaciers, water resources and mountain ecosystems.  Climates of mountains and of the free troposphere have attracted scientists of the enlightenment and have been studied scientifically at least since the 18 th century. High-altitude observatories were installed in the late 19 th century, and upper-air measurements were started soon afterwards. However, even in the early 21 st century, the climate observing systems do not well cover mountain regions and specifically mountain peaks. The temperature of the free troposphere is dominated by horizontal and vertical transport of sensible and latent heat, condensation and release of latent heat, and radiation to space. Mountain peaks sometimes reach into the free troposphere, but at the same time also share characteristics of surface climate. They are strongly influenced by radiative processes of the surrounding surface, while during the day they are often within the atmospheric boundary layer. With respect to climate change, temperature trends are amplified in the tropical upper-troposphere relative to the surface due to latent heat release, while in the Arctic the surface warms faster than the free atmosphere due to strong inversions and due to feedback processes operating at the surface. Mountain peaks may see both types of amplification. Several processes have been suggested to cause an elevation dependent warming, the most important of which arguably is the snow-albedo feedback. Elevation dependent warming is also seen in model studies and in observations, although detecting this signal in observations turns out rather difficult outside the tropics due to high variability and sometimes low data quality. The observed climatic changes are expected to continue into the future.";2019;"troposphere, mountains, climate change, ecosystems, temperature"

They have played an important role in climate research as they allow daily to decadal variability and changes of temperature, pressure, and precipitation, including extremes, to be addressed. Early instrumental data can also help place twenty-first century climatic changes into a historical context such as defining preindustrial climate and its variability. Until recently, the focus was on long, high-quality series, while the large number of shorter series (which together also cover long periods) received little to no attention. The shift in climate and climate impact research from mean climate characteristics toward weather variability and extremes, as well as the success of historical reanalyses that make use of short series, generates a need for locating and exploring further early instrumental measurements. However, information on early instrumental series has never been electronically compiled on a global scale. Here we attempt a worldwide compilation of metadata on early instrumental meteorological records prior to 1850 (1890 for Africa and the Arctic). Our global inventory comprises information on several thousand records, about half of which have not yet been digitized (not even as monthly means), and only approximately 20% of which have made it to global repositories. The inventory will help to prioritize data rescue efforts and can be used to analyze the potential feasibility of historical weather data products. The inventory will be maintained as a living document and is a first, critical, step toward the systematic rescue and reevaluation of these highly valuable early records.

While studies have been previously conducted to describe relationships between physical vulnerability and features about building properties, the immediate environment and event intensity proxies, several key challenges remain. In particular, observations, especially those associated with high magnitude events, and studies designed to evaluate a comprehensive range of predictive features are both limited. To build upon previous developments, we described a workflow to support the continued development and assessment of empirical, multivariate physical vulnerability functions based on predictive accuracy. Within this workflow, we evaluated several statistical approaches, namely generalized linear models and their more complex alternatives. A series of models were built 1) to explicitly consider the effects of dimension reduction, 2) to evaluate the inclusion of interaction effects between and among predictors, 3) to evaluate an ensemble prediction method for applications where data observations are sparse, 4) to describe how model results can inform about the relative importance of predictors to explain variance in expected damages and 5) to assess the predictive accuracy of the models based on prescribed metrics. The utility of the workflow was demonstrated on data with characteristics of what is commonly acquired in ex-post field assessments.

Here, Direct Sampling (DS) is used as a non-parametric stochastic method for infilling gaps in daily streamflow records. A thorough gap-filling framework including the selection of predictor stations and the optimization of the DS parameters is developed and applied to data collected in the Volta River basin, West Africa. Various synthetic missing data scenarios are developed to assess the performance of the method, followed by a real-case application to the existing gaps in the flow records. The contribution of this study includes the assessment of the method for different climatic zones and hydrological regimes and for different upstream-downstream relations among the gauging stations used for gap filling. Tested in various missing data conditions, the method allows a precise and reliable simulation of the missing data by using the data patterns available in other stations as predictor variables.

Archetype analysis is a particularly salient approach in this regard that helps researchers to understand and compare patterns of (un)sustainability in heterogeneous cases. Archetype analysis avoids traps of overgeneralization and ideography by identifying reappearing but nonuniversal patterns that hold for well-defined subsets of cases. It can be applied by researchers working in inter- or transdisciplinary settings to study sustainability issues from a broad range of theoretical and methodological standpoints. However, there is still an urgent need for quality standards to guide the design of theoretically rigorous and practically useful archetype analyses. To this end, we propose four quality criteria and corresponding research strategies to address them: (1) specify the domain of validity for each archetype, (2) ensure that archetypes can be combined to characterize single cases, (3) explicitly navigate levels of abstraction, and (4) obtain a fit between attribute configurations, theories, and empirical domains of validity. These criteria are based on a stocktaking of current methodological challenges in archetypes research, including: to demonstrate the validity of the analysis, delineate boundaries of archetypes, and select appropriate attributes to define them. We thus contribute to a better common understanding of the approach and to the improvement of the research design of future archetype analyses.";2019;"global, natural resources, archetype, sustainability, quality"

The narrative analysis unpacks the dual function of humour as an explanatory tool during interviews, and as an everyday practice to negotiate adversity within the patriarchal stronghold of wildland firefighting. The study shows: a) how humour masks widespread occurrences of gender discrimination, and b) that the use of humour to negotiate gendered relations in everyday practices, and to describe embodied gendered identities, makes a difference for firefighter women's experiences of normative workplace culture.

The study draws on three concepts: faith as performative, embodiment, and the ?holding environment? as a system that shapes coping capacity. Faith emerges in the study as having two modalities (introspection and group-communion) that are not synonymous with religious adherence. Instead it is linked to the holding environment, which comprises the strategies that individuals and groups have developed to cope with risks and exposure, through their embodied responses, and the observed responses of others, to the impact of potential and actual harm. The holding environment provides mental, spiritual and physical spaces and practices where disaster recovery workers can safely confide, reflect, debate, grow and heal. These processes, in turn, provide anchor points and sense of purpose. They also accentuate the individual and collective choices we face in terms of mitigating and adapting to growing social and environmental uncertainty with climate change.";2019;"coping, caring, believing, faith, disaster"

The data were quality controlled and homogenized using publicly available data from surrounding countries as well as newly recovered data from twelve stations in Eritrea. Overall, the Asmara data showed a consistent pattern and there were no outliers outside of four standard deviations from the corresponding reference. Climate indices were calculated using the program RClimDex. Overall, eight indices for description of the air temperature data and ten for precipitation data were calculated. The analyses of averages and indices reveal large climatic variations in the central highlands of Eritrea.

In the Tanintharyi Region of Myanmar, a forest frontier landscape facing oil palm and rubber expansion, little is known about local perspectives on ES and the direct impact of trade-offs from land use change. This study assessed the trade-offs experienced with respect to 10 locally important ES from land user perspectives using social valuation techniques. The results show that while intact forests provide the most highly valued ES bundle, the conversion to rubber plantations entails fewer negative trade-offs than that to oil palm. Rubber plantations offer income, fuelwood, a good microclimate, and even new cultural identities. By contrast, oil palm concessions have caused environmental pollution, and, most decisively, have restricted local people?s access to the respective lands. The ES water flow regulation is seen as the most critical if more forest is converted; other ES, such as non-timber forest products, can be more easily substituted. We conclude that, from local perspectives, the impact of ES trade-offs highly depends on access to land and opportunities to adapt to change.";2019;"trade-offs, ecosystem, services, land, perspectives"

A Multi-stakeholder Discussion Group co-produced nine videos with experienced farmers and wine producers showing sustainable soil management practices. We analysed the video audio-visual content and drew on reflections of the coproduction process, referring to concepts of system, target and transformation knowledge, as well as on social learning. The analysis showed a broad range of means (or actions) for sustainable soil management in arable land management, fodder production and wine growing that are aligned to transformation knowledge. The research showed that farmers refer to three phases of social learning, light-bulb moments, coping with challenges and gaining successful expertise. These are not just linear processes of individuals, four types of social learning were also found in the video analysis: 1) learning from observing actions of others, 2) sharing experiences with storytelling, 3) informal social interactions and 4) being a role model with a large social network. Videos enable transformation knowledge to be shared with peers using storytelling; this powerful narrative communication style provides credibility and respects the ?thought style? of the target audience group. We conclude that for successful implemention of sustainable actions, it is important to address a specific target group and share transformation knowledge built upon system and target knowledge. The social learning video method is a viable way to enable social learning between science, administration and practice and has potential for fostering change in sustainable soil management.";2019;"sustainable, social, learning, videos, transformation"

Schinke and M. Papathoma-K{\"o";"Irrespective of the magnitude and spatial extend, the consequences of a natural hazard are strongly connected to the vulnerability of elements at risk (e.g. people, buildings and infrastructure). It is, therefore, obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required for successful disaster risk reduction. The need for vulnerability assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as the socio-economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and coping capacities of affected communities. Vulnerability is multidimensional (physical, social, economic, etc.), however, the dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to human lives is the physical one. We focus here on the physical vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in small and steep mountain catchments. These processes include fluvial sediment transport, debris floods, and debris flows. Furthermore, we included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential catchments. Physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the last 20 years. Several methods to assess physical vulnerability of buildings towards flash floods, debris flows and hyper-concentrated flows can be found in the literature. The plethora of methods and approaches may be classified under the following three categories: vulnerability matrices, vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices. We provide a short review of these methods which became available over the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain hazard risk management, giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves. The approaches presented herein are highlighted through case studies from the European Alps and beyond. Furthermore, challenges in vulnerability assessment including data requirements, need for improved event documentation, uncertainties and challenges related to future climate and socio-economic changes are outlined. Finally, a discussion on progress-driving factors such as new technologies (e.g. mobile apps, drones), citizen science and new innovative assessment methods is provided.";2019;"magnitude, vulnerability, physical, mountain, hazard"

The wind speed observations show a significant decrease in the Alps and on the southern Alpine slopes in the period 1981?2010. However, the 20CRv2c data reveal that the recent trends lie well within the decadal variability over longer time periods and no clear signs of a systematic wind stilling can be found for Switzerland. The ensemble of RCMs shows large biases in the annual mean wind speed over the Jura mountains, and some members also show large biases in the Alps compared to station observations. The spatial distribution of the model biases varies strongly between the RCMs, while the resolution and the driving global model have less impact on the pattern of the model bias. The RCMs are mostly able to represent the seasonality of wind speed on the Plateau but miss important details in complex terrain related to local wind systems. Most models show no significant changes in near-surface mean wind speed until the end of the 21st century. The model ensemble changes range from a 7% decrease to a 6% increase with an ensemble mean decrease of 1 to 2%. Due to model biases, the scale mismatch between model grid and station observations and the missing representation of local winds in the simulations, the changes need to be interpreted with utmost care. Future assessments might lead to major revisions even for the sign of the projected changes, in particular over complex terrain.";2019;"switzerland, wind, model, bias, trend"

Using a unique matched dataset (survey data and register data), we investigate if and how different kinds of networks, and their geography, influence firm growth in peripheral regions. We find that environment-related social capital has, in most cases, positive effects on firm growth. This holds especially for extra-regional social capital. For production-related social capital, however, a positive effect is only significant for geographically proximate clients and suppliers. Consequently, conclusions about what drives firm growth in the periphery have to be nuanced and need to encompass different approaches and explanations.";2019;"social, capital, firm, competitiveness, peripheral"

AMs can rely on outputs of numerical weather predictionmodels in the context of operational forecasting or outputs of climate models in thecontext of climate impact studies. The predictors archive is usually a reanalysisdataset. Di?erent meteorological variables from the NCEP reanalysis 1 were assessed after itsrelease to identify the best predictors for daily precipitation. This former work provided abasis on the top of which more complex methods were developed by adding additionalvariables in a stepwise way. However, the ?rst predictors of the method often remain thesame, and the selection of new predictors is done manually. Nowadays, several newreanalysis datasets are available and were proven more skilful for analog methods than theNCEP reanalysis 1. The accuracy of several variables has signi?cantly improved and morevariables are now available than before. Therefore, the former selection of predictor variablesmight not be optimal anymore. Di?erent variables from various reanalyses shouldbe assessed, which can turn out to be a cumbersome task if done manually andextensively. Genetic algorithms (GAs) were shown to successfully optimize the parameters of theAMs, such as the spatial domain on which the predictors are compared, the selection of thepressure levels and the temporal windows of the predictors, a weighting between predictors,and the number of analog dates to select. GAs can jointly optimize all parameters of AMs andget closer to a global optimum by taking into account the dependencies between parameters.Moreover, GAs can objectively infer parameters that were previously assessed manually, andcan take into account new degrees of freedom.

This study investigates the isotopic fractionation of major processes during the Cd transfer from soils to cereal grains. Thereto, soil, soil solution, wheat and barley plants (roots, straw and grains) were sampled in the field at three study sites during two vegetation periods. Cd concentrations and d114/110Cd values were determined in all samples. The composition of the soil solution was analyzed and the speciation of the dissolved Cd was modelled. Isotopic fractionation between soils and soil solutions (D114/110Cd20-50cm-soil solution ? 0.61 to 0.68?) was nearly constant among the three soils. Cd isotope compositions in plants were heavier than in soils (D114/110Cd0-20cm-plants ? 0.55 to 0.31?) but lighter than in soil solutions (D114/110Cdsoil solution-plants ? 0.06e0.36?) and these differences correlated with Cd plant-uptake rates. In a conceptual model, desorption from soil, soil solution  peciation, adsorption on root surfaces, diffusion, and plant uptake were identified as the responsible processes for the Cd isotope fractionation between soil, soil solution and plants whereas the first two processes dominated over the last three processes. Within plants, compartments with lower Cd concentrations were enriched in light isotopes which might be a consequence of Cd retention mechanisms, following a Rayleigh fractionation, in which barley cultivars were more efficient than wheat cultivars.";2019;"cd, plants, isotopic, fractionation, soils"

While rural inhabitants have been subject of various ?sustainability studies?, the consideration of the social dimension in agriculture is still rather underrepresented. Our conceptual framework can contribute to enhance the understanding of the social dimension of sustainability by utilizing a social science-based approach to comprehend the complexity of social interaction in agriculture: Based on Parsons' system approach, we capture the components of a social system that encompasses agriculture and its embeddedness in society. This includes all major actors, their interactions and institutions. Further, we develop Maslow's hierarchy of needs as well as the rights approach into a sustainability scale. We call the conceptual framework the sustainable agricultural social system.

A soil spectral library was set upto assess the variation in the SOC for 1440 soil samples from four land use types (field crops, permanent crops,forest, and grazing land), three slope categories (flat, moderate, and steep) and two aspects (north- and south-facing). For field crops, only one factor ? slope ? significantly affected SOC, with SOC content in north-facingareas appearing to be higher in flat areas (0.75 %) than in hilly areas (0.51 %). However, in south-facing areas,SOC content was also higher in flat areas (0.74 %) than in hilly areas (0.50 %). For permanent crops, whichwere inter-planted with field crops, the slope significantly affected SOC content, which improved to 0.97 % inflat north-facing and 0.96 % in flat south-facing areas, scoring higher than hilly south- and north-facing areas(0.79 %). In the grazing land use system, both of the investigated factors ? aspect and slope ? significantly af-fected the SOC content, which was significantly higher in flat areas (north-facing: 0.84 %, south-facing: 0.77 %)than in hilly areas (north-facing: 0.61 %, south-facing: 0.56 %).

This study highlights the ability of visibleand near-infrared (VNIR) spectroscopy to quantify C in diverse soils collected over a large diverse geographicarea in order to indicate that calibrations are feasible, and therefore, assessing the variation of SOC content underland use and topographic features (slope and aspect) will result in better sustainable land management planning.";2019;"land use, topographic, soil, carbon, spectroscopy"

"1306";"Floods in Meso-Scale Catchments - On Processes and Projections of Floods and Flood Loss";"Luise Keller";"Understanding the hydro-meteorological processes that lead to fluvial floods is important for various applications. Several approaches exist for classifying flood generating processes based on hydro-meteorological and catchment state conditions. However, these approaches rely on data of subdaily temporal resolution that may not be readily available in certain situations. This is frequently the case for example in the context of climate change impact assessments or for the analysis of historical floods. In the first part of this thesis we thus present an approach to delineate flood generating processes in meso-to macroscale catchments based on daily meteorological and catchment state conditions. The approach is developed and tested for a meso-scale, pre-alpine catchment for the period 1961 to 2014. Seven parameters were derived to describe the flood events with regard to spatio-temporal precipitation patterns, snow cover extent, snowmelt, and antecedent catchment wetness due to precipitation and snow melt. Based on these parameters, 5 storylines of flood generation were identified with a cluster analysis. These are (a) long duration, low intensity precipitation events with high precipitation depths, (b) long duration precipitation events with high precipitation depths and episodes of high intensities, (c) shorter duration events with high or (d) low precipitation intensity, respectively, and (e) rain-on-snow events. Distinct differences in the hydrological characteristics of the storylines were identified and could be linked to the storylines? hydro-meteorological properties. This indicates that flood generating processes in meso-scale catchments can be distinguished on the basis of daily meteorological and catchment state parameters. The approach may thus facilitate an analysis of flood generating processes in meso-to macroscale catchments using e.g. climate and discharge projections, or observational data of daily temporal resolution. The second part of this thesis makes a contribution to the assessment of uncertainties in projections of floods for future climate conditions. Here, we focus on the scenario-neutral method of climate change impact assessment that allows to analyse the sensitivity of a catchment to a range of changes in selected meteorological variables. The main challenges of the scenario-neutral approach are the choice of meteorological variables and statistics thereof, and how to generate time series representing altered climatologies of the selected variables. Different methods have been proposed for the scenario-neutral assessment of future flood occurrence, yet a comparison of conceptually different methods is still missing. In the presented study we thus apply three different scenario-neutral methods to derive discharge projections for a meso-scale, pre-alpine catchment and compare resulting climatologies of annual maximum floods (AMF). The methods differ with regard to the statistical attributes of precipitation and temperature change they consider, in the tools to generate altered meteorological time series, as well as in the type of input data they rely on. Resulting average change in mean AMF peak magnitudes and volumes was in the order of -6% to +7%, and of -11% to +14%, respectively. In addition, differences in the variability of mean AMF peak magnitude and volume change were observed (interdecile range of 20% to 46%for peak magnitudes and of 29% to 44%for flood volumes, respectively). Moreover, different relationships between flood volume and peak magnitude change resulted for the different methods. These differences were linked to disparate flood regime shifts caused by the three approaches, i.e. different flood seasonality and hydro-meteorological flood event properties. The results highlight that focussing only on selected aspects of climate change when performing scenario-neutral assessments of flood occurrence can lead to differences in the prevailing flood generating processes and thus different hydrological flood event characteristics. In the third part of this thesis we present an approach for assessing uncertainty in flood loss estimates by large ensemble modelling. Various sources of uncertainty affect the estimation of flood loss under climate change and ensemble modelling is commonly applied to represent uncertainty in few selected aspects. However, the consideration of several factors can be hampered by the high computational demand of performing resource-intensive computations a large number of times. Surrogate models can be used to reduce the computational burden of numerical models and can thus facilitate comprehensive uncertainty assessments. In the presented study we demonstrate the use of a surrogate inundation model for large ensemble flood loss modelling. The approach is exemplified for the floodplains of a mesoscale, pre-alpine study area. The surrogate model describes the relationship between flood peak magnitude and inundation depth at the flood exposed buildings for the study area and thereby replaces a fully integrated two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of projected peak discharge. Four generic sources of uncertainty were considered: The choice of a scenario-neutral method, climate projection uncertainty, hydrological model parameter sets, and vulnerability function choice. In total, 81000 estimates of flood loss were derived. From these, 46500 estimates were selected according to the change of annual mean precipitation and temperature of an ensemble of regional climate models, and considered for an attribution of uncertainty. Estimated loss due to a100-year flood event showed large uncertainty ranging from a decrease of loss compared to present day climate to more than a 7-fold increase. Vulnerability function choice was identified as the most important source of uncertainty explaining almost half of the variation in the loss estimates. Choice of a scenario-neutral method and climate projection uncertainty jointly contributed nearly as much. These results point to a large potential of improved vulnerability modelling for reducing uncertainty in flood loss estimates for the study area. More generally, the study demonstrated how a surrogate inundation model can facilitate large ensemble flood loss modelling and thereby comprehensive uncertainty assessments.";2019;"hydro-meteorological, process, flood, uncertainty, catchment"

Maharlu Lake is a seasonal hypersaline lake in the central part of the Maharlu Basin in Southern Iran. Wastewater of various types produced within the basin is released into the seasonal freshwater rivers that ultimately drain into the lake. Samples were collected through one complete period of the lake water-level fluctuation. Lake surface water and shallow sediment pore water samples were collected three times at three piezometric stations at different distances from the river inflow points. Lake sediment samples were collected twice, and water samples from the inflowing rivers were collected five times. Changes in surface runoff and agricultural wastewater inflows were responsible for seasonal hydrochemical changes and changes in the As concentrations in the inflowing rivers. Data from the stations close to the river inflows indicated that the dissolved As concentrations across the sediment?water interface in Maharlu Lake are mostly controlled by evaporation and interactions between the surface water and shallow pore water. However, data from the station far from the freshwater inflows indicated that the brine and precipitated evaporites were at equilibrium and redox processes (e.g., iron (hydr)oxide dissolution and secondary sulphide precipitation) control the dissolved As concentration in pore water. The results confirmed the role of lake water evaporation in As enrichment and As sequestration by secondary sulphide minerals in sediment below the sediment?water interface. Climate change may alter the lake chemistry and As behavior in near future.";2019;"sediment, water, contaminants, maharlu, as"

As multiple UN policy frameworks stress, DRR is crucial to mitigate the mounting environmental and socioeconomic costs of disasters globally. However, specialized DRR guidelines are needed for biodiverse, multi-hazard regions like  mountains. Ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) emphasizes ecosystem conservation, restoration, and sustainable management as key elements for DRR. We propose that integrating the emerging field of EcoDRR with community-based DRR (CB-DRR) will help address the increasing vulnerabilities of mountain people and ecosystems. Drawing on a global mountain synthesis, we present paradoxes that create challenges for  DRR in mountains and examine these paradoxes through examples from the 2015 Nepal earthquakes. We propose four principles for integrated CB- and Eco-DRR that address these challenges: (1) governance and institutional arrangements that fit local needs; (2) empowerment and capacity-building to strengthen community resilience; (3) discovery and sharing of constructive practices that combine local and scientific knowledge; and (4) approaches focused on well-being and equity. We illustrate the reinforcing relationship between integrated CB- and Eco-DRR principles with examples from other mountain systems worldwide.

During the month prior to the flood event three heavy precipitation events (HPEs) occurred. The first two events preconditioned the catchment and brought the lake close to its flood level. During the third event the lake level rose above the flood threshold. At the same time, anomalously high blocking activity was observed in the northern North?Atlantic/European region. This study describes the synoptic development during the month prior to the flood and investigate the role of atmospheric blocking for the formation of the HPEs using ERA?Interim data. Atmospheric blocks are identified as persistent negative potential vorticity (PV) anomalies in the upper troposphere.  All three heavy precipitation events were forced by upper?level equatorward elongated streams of stratospheric high?PV air (PV streamers). These PV streamers formed in the strong deformation field upstream and downstream of single blocks or in between two blocks. During the third and most persistent heavy precipitation episode the eastward propagation of the PV streamer was prevented by a downstream block for several days leading to a stationary upper?level north?eastward flow and a prolonged period of heavy precipitation over the catchment. The study identifies and quantifies a potential feedback between heavy precipitation and blocks via diabatic depletion of PV. It is shown that a substantial fraction of the diabatically modified low PV air (63%) that reached and strengthened the blocks over the Atlantic and Europe during this month experienced heating in HPE areas.";2019;"lake, flood, precipitation, blocking, diabatic"

We explored these transitions in the light of major continuous trends and discrete events highlighted by local farmers as influencing their land use decisions. Our results suggest that the process of establishing protected areas first reinforced ongoing deforestation, but later led to a significant reduction of forest loss rates. Recent cash crop booms appear to have induced agricultural intensification processes in our study landscapes, while also putting additional pressure on forests, as people may be encouraged to clear forest for cash crop cultivation.

South-western Amazonia is covered by an extensive seasonally flooded savannah, known as the Llanos de Moxos. Severe drought during the southern hemisphere winter, followed by months of permanent waterlogging, means that forests only grow on the most elevated parts of the landscape, mostly river and paleoriver levees and crevasse splays. Paleoclimate reconstructions from surrounding areas show that a shift to wetter conditions at around 4 kyr BP caused an increase in forest cover. However, the impact that this change in climate had on the landscape of the Llanos de Moxos is unknown. Published lacustrine archives from the area only cover the last 2 kyr. Here we present new data from the analysis of paleosols located along a 300 km transect across the central Llanos. The analyses of stable carbon isotopes, from 36 paleosols, and biogenic silica, from 29 paleosols, show that the patchwork of forests and savannahs that we see today was established after the 4 kyr BP climate change. During the dry period between 8 and 4 kyr BP, most of the central Llanos de Moxos, nowadays covered with seasonally flooded savannah, were covered by Cerrado-like savannah in the west and by forest in the east. However, results also suggest that, at both regional and local scales, vegetation cover has been influenced by changes in topography resulting from the region's river dynamics.";2019;"evolution, climate, forest, savannah, river"

Yet the literature points to a much more diverse perspective on entrepreneurship and regional development. In this chapter, we argue that regional characteristics such as the extent to which a region faces demographic change (population growth or decline, population ageing, emigration of youth, etc.) may exert a strong influence both on the individual propensity to start a business and the aggregate numbers of entrepreneurial activities. In addition, demographic change also influences the types of businesses or business models found in different regional contexts. With this idea in mind, we argue that the opportunities and challenges that are associated with old age entrepreneurship depend strongly on the regional context. We place old age entrepreneurship into a regional context and illustrate the ways in which opportunities and constraints arise from such a context and, in particular, from demographic change occurring in different regional types.";2019;"entrepreneurship, regional, demographic change, old age, opportunities"

In times of a global trend to fight for the persistence of singular nations instead of dissolving national boundaries, the book suggests focusing on the development of attachments and detachments to nationalising beliefs, corporeal experiences and everyday routines, in order to understand the ways in which bodies? different capacities to affect and to be affected are of central importance for the emergence and the persistence of nationalisms. Based on eight months of ethnographic field work, consisting of observant participation within families, field notes from attendance at public holidays and commemoration ceremonies and qualitative interviews conducted between 2012 and 2014 in Azerbaijan, the book develops the concept of affective nationalism as the banal affirmation of the national emerging in moments of encounter between different bodies and objects.

Affectual intensities emerge through encounters between different bodies and objects, and are deeply power?laden, enabling, disabling, transforming, and restricting geographic research. We attend to three moments of resonance that surfaced in Elisabeth Militz's field research on nationalism in Azerbaijan. In each, we show how attending to affectual intensities reveals much about the work of power in nationalism and in the constitution of geographic knowledge about it. The paper calls for an affectual methodology, a process of critical writing, reflection, and rewriting about moments of resonance between different bodies and objects in the field, and as we analyse, present, and write up our data. This is a layered, dialogic, and collaborative writing strategy that, we argue, enables us to write through and with affect.

Soil aggregation, which is the major driver of mechanical soil stability, is often treated as a static phenomenon, even though aggregate turnover is continually ongoing. In fact, some breakdown of macroaggregates is necessary to allow new aggregate formation and inclusion of new organic matter into microaggregates. We determined how aggregate turnover times were affected by AMF by tracking movement of rare earth elements (REE), applied as their immobile oxides, between aggregate size classes, and using X-ray fluorescence microscopy to spatially localize REEs in a sample of aggregates. Here we show that AMF increased large macroaggregate formation and slowed down disintegration of large and small macroaggregates. Microaggregate turnover was increased in the presence of AMF. Internal aggregate organization suggested that although formation of microaggregates by accretion of soil to particulate organic matter is common, it is not the only mechanism in operation.";2019;"ecosystem, stability, mycorrhizal, turnover, aggregation"

The rapid growth and diversification of archetype analyses has generated variations, inconsistencies, and confusion about the meanings, potential, and limitations of archetypes. Based on a systematic review, a survey, and a workshop series, we provide a consolidated perspective on the core features and diverse meanings of archetype analysis in sustainability research, the motivations behind it, and its policy relevance. We identify three core features of archetype analysis: recurrent patterns, multiple models, and intermediate abstraction. Two gradients help to apprehend the variety of meanings of archetype analysis that sustainability researchers have developed: (1) understanding archetypes as building blocks or as case typologies and (2) using archetypes for pattern recognition, diagnosis, or scenario development. We demonstrate how archetype analysis has been used to synthesize results from case studies, bridge the gap between global narratives and local realities, foster methodological interplay, and transfer knowledge about sustainability strategies across cases. We also critically examine the potential and limitations of archetype analysis in supporting evidence-based policy making through context-sensitive generalizations with case-level empirical validity. Finally, we identify future priorities, with a view to leveraging the full potential of archetype analysis for supporting sustainable development.";2019;"sustainability, patterns, meanings, analysis, policy"

Since the recent development of global shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), which have startedbeing downscaled to lower scales, the potential of scenarios to be relevant for decision making and facilitate appreciation and inclusionof different perspectives has been increasing, compared with a single-scale global scenario set. However, in practice, quantitativedownscaling of global scenarios results in narratives that are compressed from the global level to fit the local context to enhanceconsistency between global and local scales. We brought forward the concept of scenario archetypes to analyze multiscale SSP scenarionarratives and highlight important diverging assumptions within the same archetype. Our methodology applied scenario archetypesboth as typologies, to allocate specific cases of scenarios into existing scenario archetypes, and building blocks, conceptualized withworldviews from cultural theory. Although global SSPs generally match existing archetypes and tend to be well defined, the sociallyunequal SSPs at subglobal scales are more nuanced, and dominant worldviews are much less straighforward to interpret than in globalscenarios. The closest match was the great transition?sustainability (SSP1) archetype, whereas the most divergent was the market forces?fossil fuel development (SSP5) archetype. Overall, our results highlight the need to improve uptake of bottom-up approaches in globalscenarios to improve appreciation of different perspectives as sought after in multiscale scenarios.";2019;"drivers, scenarios, climate change impacts, downscaling, archetypes"

Keesstra and Margreth Keiler";"Dam removal can generate geomorphic disturbances, including channel bed and bank erosion andassociated abrupt/pulsed release and downstream transfer of reservoir sediment, but the type and rate ofgeomorphic response often are hard to predict. The situation gets even more complex in systems whichhave been impacted by multiple dams and a long and complex engineering history. In previous studiesone-dimensional (1-D) models were used to predict aspects of post-removal channel change. However,these models do not consider two-dimensional (2-D) effects of dam removal such as bank erosionprocesses and lateral migration. In the current study the impacts of multiple dams and their removal onchannel evolution and sediment delivery were modeled by using a 2-D landscape evolution model(CAESAR-Lisflood) focusing on the following aspects: patterns, rates, and processes of geomorphicchange and associated sediment delivery on annual to decadal timescales. The current modeling studyrevealed that geomorphic response to dam removal (i.e., channel evolution and associated rates ofsediment delivery) in multiple dam settings is variable and complex in space and time. Complexity ingeomorphic system response is related to differences in dam size, the proximity of upstream dams,related buffering effects and associated rates of upstream sediment supply, and emerging feedbackprocesses as well as to the presence of channel stabilization measures. Modeled types and rates ofgeomorphic adjustment, using the 2-D landscape evolution model CAESAR-Lisflood, are similar to thosereported in previous studies. Moreover, the use of a 2-D method showed some advantages compared to1-D models, generating spatially varying patterns of erosion and deposition before and after damremoval that provide morphologies that are more readily comparable tofield data as well as features likethe lateral re-working of past reservoir deposits which further enables the maintenance of sedimentdelivery downstream.";2019;"geomorphic, dam removal, 2-d, sediment delivery, complexity"

However little is known about the decadal variation in the frequency of blocks and th eactivity of storm tracks and their relation to the two most important low-frequency oceanic modes ofvariability, the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). To address this question, first the representation of blocks, storm tracks and Alpine circulation types is assessed in recently released centennial reanalyses during the 20th century.While interannual variability is represented similarly in all centennial reanalyses, the trends in particular forstorm track activity before 1950 differ substantially between the NOAA 20th century reanalyses (20CR and20CRv2c) and ECMWF centennial reanalyses (ERA-20C and CERA-20C). Therefore, the analysis of theconnection between the AMO and PDO and the mid-latitudinal circulation is restricted to the period 1950?2010. All centennial reanalyses agree on the anomaly patterns associated with the different AMO/PDO phases. We find no significant connections except a southward (northward) shift of the storm track over the North Pacific as well as the North Atlantic during the positive (negative) PDO phase. The ERA-20CM atmosphere-only model ensemble captures this relationship, indicating that the ocean forces the atmospherein the North Pacific.

This relationship, which typically follows a power law, summarizes all catchment-scale subsurface hydrological processes and has long been known to be a key descriptor of the hydrologic response. In this paper, we tested a range of common recession analysis methods (RAMs) and propose the use of an analytic streamflow distribution model as an alternative method for recession parameter estimation and to objectively compare different RAMs. The used analytical model assumes power law recessions, in combination with a stochastic process for streamflow triggering rainfall events. This streamflow distribution model is used in the present framework to establish reference values for the recession parameters via maximum likelihood estimation. The model-based method has two main advantages: (a) joint estimation of both power law recession parameters (coefficient and exponent), which are known to be strongly correlated, and (b) parameter estimation based on all available streamflow data (no recession selection). The approach is applied to five rainfall-dominated catchments in Switzerland with 40 years of continuous streamflow observations. The results show that the estimated recession parameters are highly dependent on methodological choices and that some RAMs lead to biased estimates. The recession selection method is shown to be of prime importance for a reliable description of catchment-scale recession behaviour, in particular in presence of short streamflow records. The newly proposed model-based RAM yields robust results, which supports the further development of this method for comparative hydrology and opens new perspectives for understanding the recession behaviour of catchments.";2019;"storage-outflow, hydrologic, methodological, recession, catchments"

Despite of the wide-spread glacier retreat since the development of HP infrastructure in the 20th century, little quantitative information is available about the role of glacier mass loss for HP. In this paper, we provide the first regional quantification for the share of Alpine hydropower production that directly relies on the waters released by glacier mass loss, i.e. on the depletion of long-term ice storage that cannot be replenished by precipitation in the coming decades. Based on the case of Switzerland (which produces over 50% of its electricity from hydropower), we show that since 1980, 3.0%?4.0% (1.0?1.4â¯TWh yr?1) of the country-scale hydropower production was directly provided by the net glacier mass loss and that this share is likely to reduce substantially by 2040?2060. For the period 2070?2090, a production reduction of about 1.0â¯TWh yr?1 is anticipated. The highlighted strong regional differences, both in terms of HP share from glacier mass loss and in terms of timing of production decline, emphasize the need for similar analyses in other Alpine or high latitude regions.";2019;"elevation, latitude, hydropower, glacier, warming"

This paper explores how smartphones co?constitute fieldwork when they are used as research instruments. Drawing from a research project on young people's nightlife in Switzerland, we use Ahmed's ideas of emotions to show how smartphones are not inert research tools but emotionally entangled in the field. We argue that doing research with smartphones visibly in fieldwork has an effect on the relationships between the people, practices, and places of the field site. More specifically, we propose that these effects of emotions call for a renewed scrutiny of research ethics, particularly as smartphones increasingly become part of research designs.";2019;"geographies, smartphones, fieldwork, emotions, ethics"

A key component of the assimilation system is the background-error covariance matrix, which controls how the information from observations spreads into the model space. In ensemble-based approaches, the background-error covariance matrix can be estimated from the ensemble. Due to the usually limited ensemble size, the background-error covariance matrix is subject to the so-called sampling error. We test different methods to reduce the effect of sampling error in a published paleo data assimilation setup. For this purpose, we conduct a set of experiments, where we assimilate early instrumental data and proxy records stored in trees, to investigate the effect of 1) the applied localization function and localization length scale; 2) multiplicative and additive inflation techniques; 3) temporal localization of monthly data, which applies if several time steps are estimated together in the same assimilation window. We find that the estimation of the background-error covariance matrix can be improved by additive inflation where the background-error covariance matrix is not only calculated from the sample covariance, but blended with a climatological covariance matrix. Implementing a temporal localization for monthly resolved data also led to a better reconstruction.";2019;"data, assimilation, paleoclimatology, error, covariance"

Vijge and Robin Metcalfe and Linda Wallbott and Christoph Oberlack";"Many resource-rich countries face the paradoxical situation that their wealth in natural resources coincides with low economic and human development rates. To address this so-called resource curse, academics and practitioners turn their hopes to institutional quality. Yet whether, how and with what consequences institutional quality is transformed in resource curse contexts remains poorly understood, especially so at subnational levels. The most widely implemented initiative that seeks to address the resource curse through enhanced institutional quality is the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). This article analyses to what extent and how the EITI transforms institutional quality at national and subnational levels in Myanmar, focusing on transparency, civil society participation and accountability. We show that many transformations go beyond the official EITI process and report. While the EITI report itself is not heavily used by civil society organisations (CSOs), the EITI process motivated CSOs to gather data and organise themselves both around and beyond EITI-related issues at subnational levels. Such participatory processes of constituting transparency improved relations between the (regional) government, CSOs and private companies, but also created new forms of in- and exclusion among civil society. While avenues opened up for CSOs to demand accountability regarding the impacts of resource extraction, the extent to which they are able to trigger action of extractive industry actors in their region remains limited. In conclusion, we argue that transformations in institutional quality are not characterised by a linear trajectory from transparency in the form of the EITI report to accountability, facilitated by civil society participation in EITI multi-stakeholder groups, as the EITI standard posits. Rather, transformations in institutional quality are characterised by spin-offs, dynamic interlinkages, trade-offs, limitations and a reinforcing cycle between participation and transparency within and beyond the EITI.";2019;"resource curse, institutional quality, transparency, civil society, accountability"

Drawing on long-term fieldwork in rural Russia, this paper critiques that focus and the assumed nexus between rural dispossession and farmland, as is prevents an understanding of more dispersed stakes, modes and temporalities of dispossession. I introduce the concept of dispersed dispossession which advances our understanding of social and relational objects of dispossession beyond natural resources (such as sustaining institutions and infrastructures), and the tangled, complex, often slow and silent modes and temporalities of dispossession beyond spectacular events. I show how the concept sheds new light on current agrarian change in Russia, and how it contributes to debates on (rural) dispossession and ?land grabs? more generally.";2019;"geography,agrarian,dispossession,russia,farmland"

Ethnographies can animate thebroader debates on slow violence, infuse them with new concepts and political urgencies, andrelate them to new sites and problems. Conversely, the problem of slow violence can advanceethnographic debates and practices, even beyond ethnographiesofslow violence in a narrowersense. I highlight two aspects. First, I explore epistemological alliances between researchersand research participants which confront forms of violence that at first remain partlyelusive to both sides. Second, I argue for multi-temporal ethnographies which work throughdrawn-out and complex timescapes of violence and loss by tracing cross-temporal connections.Notions of fieldwork are still mainly defined in spatial terms, and so the problem of slowviolence is an important reminder to pay more attention to temporal dimensions. I build thisargument on ethnographic research conducted in rural Russia, and thus also show how theconcept of slow violence helps to make sense of and to make visible those forms of lossand dispossession that often remain elusive in academic and public representations of theRussian countryside.";2019;"violence, ethnography, methodological, epistemological, temporal"

First, I undertake the important task of identifying discursive and visual elements of the image, as well as the image?text pattern in order to understand how meaning is created. Second, I investigate the concrete praxis of the image: How do images argue, substantiate, and demonstrate in a way that allows viewers to make meaning out of them? Third, I follow a productive step of contextualizing the praxis of the image. To understand how visual messages are effectively conveyed, and how images help to create a politically strategic context and persuade viewers, involves examining the narratives and contexts that the images rely on in order to be understood by viewers. Visual analysis allows for insights into the ways in which visual constructions of reality are created. Furthermore, this article offers methodological strategies that are key to understanding how images are used to depict and construct realities and how these realities are accepted as true, as it is the case with the posters designed for the Against Mass Immigration initiative.";2019;"election posters, initiative, visual analysis, political messages, reality"

To manage disaster risk, government commissioned inquiries have called for greater investment in mitigation. This article critically examines the call for a shift in funding priority towards pre-disaster mitigation measures, in the context of growing concerns around the ability of households to access and afford insurance. It examines mitigation measures in the context of three prominent Australian disasters: the Black Saturday bushfires (Victoria, 2009), the Queensland floods (2010?2011), and Cyclone Yasi (Queensland, 2011). We argue that as a mode of disaster security, mitigation operates as a complex assemblage of logics and practices of protection, preparedness, and resilience, which problematizes simplistic protection/resilience binaries. On the one hand, mitigation serves as a mode of protection, which underscores the dominant maladaptive rationality of insurance. It promises a collective solution to uninsurability that is limited by government fiscal constraints and growing employment of risk-reflective insurance pricing. On the other hand, there is evidence of an emergent rationality of household insurance as a path to resilience and preparedness{--";2019;"vulnerable, disaster, mitigation, insurance, resilience"

Through this two-dimensional process, corporations can secure access to land, exert control over local communities and transform the local social relations of reciprocity serving as the pillars of resistance. Our results indicate that contract farming changes rural agrarian relations, transforms local family institutions by carefully selecting a few household members with influence into the scheme and selectively dispossessing the poor community members.";2018;"contract, farming, dependencies, land, control"

The conventional approach to representing uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change is probabilistic, based on ensembles of climate model simulations. In the face of deep uncertainties, the known limitations of this approach are becoming increasingly apparent. An alternative is thus emerging which may be called a ?storyline? approach. We define a storyline as a physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways. No a priori probability of the storyline is assessed; emphasis is placed instead on understanding the driving factors involved, and the plausibility of those factors. We introduce a typology of four reasons for using storylines to represent uncertainty in physical aspects of climate change: (i) improving risk awareness by framing risk in an event-oriented rather than a probabilistic manner, which corresponds more directly to how people perceive and respond to risk; (ii) strengthening decision-making by allowing one to work backward from a particular vulnerability or decision point, combining climate change information with other relevant factors to address compound risk and develop appropriate stress tests; (iii) providing a physical basis for partitioning uncertainty, thereby allowing the use of more credible regional models in a conditioned manner and (iv) exploring the boundaries of plausibility, thereby guarding against false precision and surprise. Storylines also offer a powerful way of linking physical with human aspects of climate change.";2018;"applied, uncertainties, storylines, risk, human"

Currently, the main focus of such analysis is on losses on building structure. However, loss on household contents accounts for up to 30% of the total losses on buildings due to floods. Based on insurance claim records, we developed and (cross-)validated two functions. The models based on linear regressions estimate the monetary loss and the degree of loss of household contents by the monetary and degree of loss for building structure, respectively. The main focus herein is to develop functions which provide robustness in prediction and transferability to other regions. Both models generate appropriate results with a comparative advantage of the relative over the absolute loss model. Our results indicate that the ratio of household content to building structure loss is decreasing relatively in regions with comparatively high losses or degrees of loss. A detailed examination of the model residuals, shows that the Box-Cox transformation works well to accurately fit a standard regression model to general right-skewed loss data as the transformed data meet the assumptions of a regression model.";2018;"flood, risk, loss, model, validation"

The data depend on political, economic and technological factors, as we show with a range of data coverage maps. We term awareness of and sensitivity to this context-dependence ?climate data empathy,? and argue that context should be seen as a source of information to be communicated along with the data. Such context not only provides additional information about the data products, but may help in designing communication strategies and contribute more generally to raising awareness of the contingency of environmental data.

In addition, demographic change also influences the types of businesses or business models found in different regional contexts. With this idea in mind, we argue that the opportunities and challenges that are associated with old age entrepreneurship depend strongly on the regional context. We place old age entrepreneurship into a regional context and illustrate the ways in which opportunities and constraints arise from such a context and, in particular, from demographic change occurring in different regional types.";2018;"entrepreneurship, regional, demographic, old age, opportunities"

This article studies local policies of SMSTs within the metropolitan region of Zurich (Switzerland) and the impact of local policies on the economic specialization of these towns. Switzerland serves as an interesting context in which to study SMSTs, particularly those in metropolitan regions, due to their constant growth and the high local autonomy enjoyed by their local governments. Using a multiple case study design that relies on a pair-wise comparison, we find that the economic specialization of SMSTs can mainly be explained by factors that are exogenous to local policy-making such as the town?s location and its connectivity. Land-use strategies are the only local policies that can influence the economic specialization of SMSTs. Therefore, SMSTs are well advised to invest in professionalized land-use departments and to coordinate their land-use strategies with neighbouring jurisdictions.";2018;"economic performance, local policies, smsts, metropolitan regions, land-use"

Here we provide a summary of a survey we have undertaken of several meteorological and climate data rescue projects, in order to identify the needs of climate data rescue services. To make these efforts more sustainable, additional integrated activities are needed. We argue that meteorological and climate data rescue must be seen as a continuous, coordinated long?term effort. Technical developments (e.g. data assimilation), new scientific questions (e.g. process understanding of extreme events) and new social (e.g. risk assessment, health) or economic (e.g. new renewable energy sources, agriculture and forestry, tourism, infrastructure, etc.) services are highlighting the immense value of data previously neglected or never considered. This continuous effort is currently undertaken by projects of various sizes, structure, funding and staffing, as well as by dedicated programmes, ranging from those within many national weather services down to ?grassroots? initiatives. These activities are often not sufficiently coordinated, staffed, or funded at an international level and will benefit considerably from climate data rescue services being established within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) (https://climate.copernicus.eu/).";2018;"climate, data, rescue, projects, sustainable"

"1425";"Spatio-Temporal Dynamics and Drivers of Flood Risk Change. Perspectives of Coupled Component Models";"Andreas Paul Zischg";"Extreme floods are one of the most damaging natural hazards, accounting for the majority of all economic losses from natural hazards worldwide. Several intertwined natural and anthropogenic drivers influence flood risk and its change: global warming, precipitation patterns, flood triggering processes, river morphology, river engineering works, population and values at risk, and flood risk reduction strategies. Sustainable flood risk management requires understanding all aspects of flood risk and its change in space and time. Thus, flood risks must be analyzed from a dynamic rather than a static perspective. However, methods to analyze and quantify environmental and socio-economic changes related to flood risk, both in space and time, are nearly not existent.  Within this cumulative habilitation thesis methods are examined and developed that allow the analysis of past and future changes in both the natural and human environment with a spatially explicit perspective, and methods that allow disentangling the different drivers of change that are mostly interwoven and have opposing effects on flood risk evolution. The habilitation extends the frontiers of research on flood risk changes with three main methodological approaches: (1) data-driven analyses of environmental and socio-economic change, (2) development of models for specific aspects of flood risk, and (3) model coupling.  Coupled component models provide an interesting approach for analyzing flood risk change, for modelling feedback mechanisms between human activities and the natural environment, and for the regionalization of global environmental and socio-economic changes. The habilitation thesis gives an outlook for enabling coupled model frameworks to predict and evaluate the effects of different adaptation strategies on flood risk evolution. Finally a modelling framework that couples specialist models toward whole-system models offers the potential for obtaining an universalist view and unifying several approaches in geography. Such a holistic approach is supporting the search for sustainable solutions for the complex and interconnected problems we are facing today.";2018;"floods, drivers, management, analysis, models"

Nowadays, many reanalyses are available and their impact on the downscaled variable is not often considered. The present work assessed the impact of ten reanalyses on the performance of seven variants of analogue methods for statistical precipitation downscaling at 301 stations in Switzerland. Even though the study location is in a data-rich region, significant differences were found between reanalyses and their impact on the performance of the method can be even higher than the choice of the predictor variables. There was no single overall winner, but a selection of recommended reanalyses resulting in higher skill scores depending on the considered predictor variables. The impact of the output spatial resolution was assessed for different types of variables. Output resolutions below one degree were found to be often of low to no interest. Reanalyses with longer archives allow the pool of potential analogues to be increased, resulting in better performance. However, when adding variables affected by errors in a more distant past, the skill score decreased again. The use of multiple members from two reanalyses was also tested over a recent and a past period. The benefit of using members to increase the performance by better incorporating the uncertainties was found to be limited, and even problematic with methods using multiple analogy levels.";2018;"downscaling, reanalyses, precipitation, impact, performance"

Two radar-based hail detection products and an automatic thunderstorm-tracking algorithm were reprocessed for the Extended convective season (April?September) between 2002 and 2016. More than 1.1 Million convective cells were automatically tracked over the full radar domain, and over 191,000 storms and 31,000 hail streaks in the considered subdomain were selected for analysis following consistency and robustness tests. The year-to-year variability in t h e number of hailstorms reveals two types of convective seasons: (a) a few seasons with hail frequency far above the average, and (b) all other years with an average number of hailstorms. A high number of hailstorms in a particular year is not correlated with a higher number of convective storms in general, but is related to a greater fraction of severe storms. Convection initiation, hail initiation, and hail frequency maxima are located along the southern and northern foothills over the pre-Alpine area and over th e Jura mountains. Few hail streaks are present over the Alpine main ridge. Hail streak frequency and location is found to be strongly dependent on the synoptic-scale weather regimes. This is important for monthly and seasonal outlooks, as well as for climate modelling. Analysis of storm life cycles shows that: (a) the majority of hail swaths contain only a single hail streak, (b) severe storms follow a more rapid evolution during their initial stages than do less severe storms, and (c) severe storms produce more spatially extended hail streaks. Finally, significant seasonal and diurnal cycles are present in most of the considered storm characteristics.";2018;"hail, radar, climatology, variability, storms"

However, the growing awareness that second homes contribute to the shortage of available land and to the standardization of landscapes in sensitive alpine environments has had little effect on the pace of development. Following the adoption of the popular initiative ?Stop the endless construction of second homes?, which aimed to limit the share of second homes in a municipality to 20% of homes in the area, a new law came into force on 1 January 2016, taking a clear stand against further uncontrolled development of second homes.  Although it is too early to measure the impact of this new legislation, many observers proclaimed the beginning of a new development era in alpine regions. However, this optimism did not consider the strong position of the developers in these regions and their strong ties to local decision makers. This article appraises the impact of the new legislation on the long-term development model of Alpine tourist destinations, which is still largely based on strategies of land rent capture. Relying on urban regime theory, we maintain that the impact of the new regulation will depend on its ability to weaken Alpine development regimes. Urban regime theory allows us to capture the complexity of the changing context of the tourism industry and highlight five main factors that potentially impact the status of the development of second homes as a central issue of local governance. Based on empirical evidence from the Upper Engadin region, we discuss the measures implemented to regulate the growth of second homes and formulate preliminary remarks on the effectiveness of the new regulations in curbing development of second homes.";2018;"tourist, homes, legislation, alpine, development"

Existing formu- las for different heat flux components were combined into 54 different total SurHF models. The coefficients in these models were calibrated based on SurHF optimization. Four calibration factors characterizing the incoming long-wave radiation, sensible, and latent heat fluxes were further investigated for the six best performing models. The combination of the modified parameterization of the Brutsaert equation for incoming atmospheric radiation and of similarity theory-based bulk parameterization algorithms for latent and sensible surface heat fluxes provided the most accurate SurHF estimates. When optimized for one lake temperature profile location, SurHF models failed to predict the temperature profile at the other location due to the spatial variability of mete- orological parameters between the two locations. Consequently, the optimal SurHF models were calibrated using two profile locations. The results emphasize that even relatively small changes in calibration factors, par- ticularly in the atmospheric emissivity, significantly modify the estimated long-term heat content. The lack of calibration can produce changes in the calculated heat content that are much higher than the observed annual climate change-induced trend. The calibration improved parameterization of bulk transfer coefficients, mainly under low wind regimes.";2018;"surhf, lake, calibration, fluxes, models"

In this study we validate the time-transgressive onset of the HO in the East Asian Monsoon (EAM) region and update a regression model of the onset of the HO versus latitude. We also estimate the onset time of the HO in the Huai River Basin to 9100-8000â¯yr BP, which is confirmed by other well-dated geological records from within and around the basin. We also compared our age estimate with data from archaeological sites in the Huai River Basin and with the record of rice remains in eastern China. The result indicates that a dramatic increase in the number of archaeological sites and the northward expansion of rice cultivation, which eventually occupied the entire Huai River Basin, corresponds temporally to the onset of the HO. Thus our results suggest that the prosperity of prehistoric culture in the Huai River Basin was enhanced by the initiation of the HO. Our findings reveal a close relationship between the onset of the HO in the Huai River Basin and human activity, and they provide an improved understanding of the response of human activity to climate change in eastern China.";2018;"controversy, onset, validation, human activity, climate change"

So far, little research has been dedicated to the prediction of SWFs in rural environments, although in practice the process is already being considered in deterministic flood hazard assessments. To test the validity of such assessments, we select four raster-based models with differing complexity and evaluate whether they reliably predict inundated areas by SWF in rural areas. The uncalibrated models are first applied to four artificial surfaces and second, to eight case studies covering manifold geographical and meteorological settings. For the case studies, the models' prediction skills are assessed based on inundated areas inferred from various sources. The models? performance is rather low for all case studies, which highlights the necessity for calibration and/or validation of such models. Moreover, the case studies provide more general conclusions concerning the modeling of SWFs in rural areas.";2018;"surface, water, floods, rural, prediction"
"1437";"Extending coupled hydrological-hydraulic model chains with a surrogate model for the estimation of flood losses";"Andreas Paul Zischg and Guido Felder and Markus Mosimann and Veronika Eva R{\"o";"In comparison to a local-scale flood risk analysis, modeling flood losses and risks at the river basin scale is challenging. Particularly in mountainous watersheds, extreme precipitation can be distributed spatially and temporally with remarkable variability. Depending on the topography of the river basin and the topological characteristics of the river network, certain rainfall patterns can lead to a synchronization of the flood peaks between tributaries and the main river. Thus, these complex interactions can lead to high variability in flood losses. In addition, flood inundation modeling at the river basin scale is computationally resource-intensive and the simulation of multiple scenarios is not always feasible. In this study, we present an approach for reducing complexity in flood-risk modeling at the river basin scale. We developed a surrogate model for flood loss analysis in the river basin by decomposing the river system into a number of subsystems. A relationship between flood magnitude and flood losses is computed for each floodplain in the river basin by means of a flood inundation and flood loss model at sub-meter resolution. This surrogate model for flood-loss estimation can be coupled with a hydrological-hydraulic model cascade, allowing to compute a high number of flood scenarios for the whole river system. The application of this model to a complex mountain river basin showed that the surrogate model approach leads to a reliable and computationally fast analysis of flood losses in a set of probable maximum precipitation scenarios. Hence, this approach offers new possibilities for stress test analyses and Monte-Carlo simulations in the analysis of system behavior under different system loads.";2018;"flood, losses, model, river, basin"

The rate of increase depends on the strength or rarity of the events; very strong and rare events tend to follow the Clausius?Clapeyron relation, whereas weaker events or precipitation averages increase at a smaller rate than expected from the Clausius?Clapeyron relation. An often overlooked aspect is seasonal occurrence of such events, which might change in the future. To address the impact of seasonality, we use a large ensemble of regional and global climate model simulations, comprising tens of thousands of model years of daily temperature and precipitation for the past, present, and future. In order to make the data comparable, they are quantile mapped to observation-based time series representative of the Aare catchment in Switzerland. Model simulations show no increase in annual maximum 1-day precipitation events (Rx1day) over the last 400 years and an increase of 10-%?20-% until the end of the century for a strong (RCP8.5) forcing scenario. This fits with a Clausius?Clapeyron scaling of temperature at the event day, which increases less than annual mean temperature. An important reason for this is a shift in seasonality. Rx1day events become less frequent in late summer and more frequent in early summer and early autumn, when it is cooler. The seasonality shift is shown to be related to summer drying. Models with decreasing annual mean or summer mean precipitation show this behaviour more strongly. The highest Rx1day per decade, in contrast, shows no change in seasonality in the future. This discrepancy implies that decadal-scale extremes are thermodynamically limited; conditions conducive to strong events still occur during the hottest time of the year on a decadal scale. In contrast, Rx1day events are also limited by other factors. Conducive conditions are not reached every summer in the present, and even less so in the future. Results suggest that changes in the seasonal cycle need to be accounted for when preparing for moderately extreme precipitation events and assessing their socio-economic impacts.";2018;"increase, precipitation, seasonality, events, future"

Lupo and Sonia Seneviratne";"Purpose of Review Atmospheric blocking events represent some of the most high-impact weather patterns in the mid-latitudes, yet they have often been a cause for concern in future climate projections. There has been low confidence in predicted future changes in blocking, despite relatively good agreement between climate models on a decline in blocking. This is due to the lack of a comprehensive theory of blocking and a pervasive underestimation of blocking occurrence bymodels. This paper reviews the state of knowledge regarding blocking under climate change, with the aim of providing an overview for those working in related fields. Recent Findings Several avenues have been identified by which blocking can be improved in numerical models, though a fully reliable simulation remains elusive (at least, beyond a few days lead time). Models are therefore starting to provide some useful information on how blocking and its impacts may change in the future, although deeper understanding of the processes at play will be needed to increase confidence in model projections. There are still major uncertainties regarding the processes most important to the onset, maintenance and decay of blocking and advances in our understanding of atmospheric dynamics, for example in the role of diabatic processes, continue to inform the modelling and prediction efforts. Summary The term ?blocking? covers a diverse array of synoptic patterns, and hence a bewildering range of indices has been developed to identify events. Results are hence not considered fully trustworthy until they have been found using several different methods. Examples of such robust results are the underestimation of blocking by models, and an overall decline in future occurrence, albeit with a complex regional and seasonal variation. In contrast, hemispheric trends in blocking over the recent historical period are not supported by different methods, and natural variability will likely dominate regional variations over the next few decades.";2018;"atmospheric, blocking, climate, models, future"

We use the concepts of institutionalization and commodification to analyze the significance of the increasing societal interest in interim housing. Contrary to housing squats, interim housing is a form of housing that has gone through a process of institutionalization. However, two different models of interim housing need to be distinguished. While non-commodified housing was historically developed to meet the needs of specific categories of tenants, commodified interim housing is managed on the owners? behalf. It is based on loaning contracts that require payment for operation costs but not rent. Consequently, the legal protection of the rights of interim users, namely low-income families, single parents, people with social aid, and students, remains weak. To understand how these different models could emerge, we analyzed the motivations of the different actors involved. Through the analysis of seven subcases in the metropolitan region of Zurich, Switzerland, the mechanisms that led to the diversification of institutionalized interim housing models will be assessed and discussed. We end with a broader discussion on the role of commodification ? and decommodification ? in Western states.";2018;"interim, housing, institutionalization, commodification, actors"

This review focuses on upper-tropospheric transient RWPs along the midlatitude jet stream. Their central characteristic is the propagation in the zonal direction as well as the transfer of wave energy from one individual trough or ridge to its downstream neighbor, a process called ?downstream development.? These RWPs sometimes act as long-range precursors to extreme weather and presumably have an influence on the predictability of midlatitude weather systems. The paper reviews research progress in this area with an emphasis on developments during the last 15 years. The current state of knowledge is summarized including a discussion of the RWP life cycle as well as Rossby waveguides. Recent progress in the dynamical understanding of RWPs has been based, in part, on the development of diagnostic methods. These methods include algorithms to identify and track RWPs in an automated manner, which can be used to extract the climatological properties of RWPs. RWP dynamics have traditionally been investigated using the eddy kinetic energy framework; alternative approaches based on potential vorticity and wave activity fluxes are discussed and put into perspective with the more traditional approach. The different diagnostics are compared to each other and the strengths and weaknesses of individual methods are highlighted. A recurrent theme is the role of diabatic processes, which can be a source for forecast errors.

This presentation shows how governance processes are evolving to regulate competing multifunctional water uses under climate change in Oberhasli (BE), in the Swiss Alps. Our approach combines the frameworks of Institutional Resource Regimes (IRR) and Polycentric Governance. The IRR framework stipulates that formal institutional rules ? public policies and property rights ? shape the leeway that is available to resource users for defining localized resource-use modalities. Polycentric governance systems are those in which political authority is dispersed amongst a range of bodies that operate in overlapping jurisdictions which are not in a hierarchical relationship to one another. Recent scholarship suggests that polycentric organization of governance has a higher capacity to deal with complex challenges arising from climate change. The project aims to analyze under which conditions polycentricity can lead to a better coordination of resource uses. We performed a detailed case study to analyze governance processes of climate change mitigation and adaptation in Switzerland. Data were collected through 22 semi-structured interviews between 2016 and 2018 and document analysis. The results show that if the number of regulations increases and if simultaneously their coherence decreases, then these constellations promotes polycentric governance. The results further show the conditions under which polycentric governance improves or not the coordination of resource uses.";2018;"resource regimes, governance processes, institutional, polycentricity, coordination"

Surface albedo retrievals have commonly been designed separately for each different spaceborne optical imager. Here, we introduce a novel type of processing framework that combines the data from two polar-orbiting optical imager families, the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The goal of the paper is to demonstrate that multisensor albedo retrievals can provide a significant reduction in the sampling time required for a robust and comprehensive surface albedo retrieval, without a major degradation in retrieval accuracy, as compared to state-of-the-art single-sensor retrievals. We evaluated the multisensor retrievals against reference in situ albedo measurements and compare them with existing datasets. The results show that global land surface albedo retrievals with a sampling period of 10 days can offer near-complete spatial coverage, with a retrieval bias mostly comparable to existing single sensor datasets, except for bright surfaces (deserts and snow) where the retrieval framework shows degraded performance because of atmospheric correction design compromises. A level difference is found between the single sensor datasets and the demonstrator developed here, pointing towards a need for further work in the atmospheric correction, particularly over bright surfaces, and inter-sensor radiance homogenization. The introduced framework is expandable to include other sensors in the future.";2018;"satellite, albedo, multisensor, atmospheric, framework"
"1460";"Effects of variability in probable maximum precipitation patterns on flood losses";"Andreas Paul Zischg and Guido Felder and Rolf Weingartner and Niall Quinn and Gemma Coxon and Jeffrey Neal and Jim Freer and Paul Bates";"The assessment of the impacts of extreme floods is important for dealing with residual risk, particularly for critical infrastructure management and for insurance purposes. Thus, modelling of the probable maximum flood (PMF) from probable maximum precipitation (PMP) by coupling hydrological and hydraulic models has gained interest in recent years. Herein, we examine whether variability in precipitation patterns exceeds or is below selected uncertainty factors in flood loss estimation and if the flood losses within a river basin are related to the probable maximum discharge at the basin outlet. We developed a model experiment with an ensemble of probable maximum precipitation scenarios created by Monte Carlo simulations. For each rainfall pattern, we computed the flood losses with a model chain and benchmarked the effects of variability in rainfall distribution with other model uncertainties. The results show that flood losses vary considerably within the river basin and depend on the timing and superimposition of the flood peaks from the basin?s sub-catchments. In addition to the flood hazard component, the other components of flood risk, exposure, and vulnerability contribute remarkably to the overall variability. This leads to the conclusion that the estimation of the probable maximum expectable flood losses in a river basin should not be based exclusively on the PMF. Consequently, the basin-specific sensitivities to different precipitation patterns and the spatial organization of the settlements within the river basin need to be considered in the analyses of probable maximum flood losses.";2018;"impacts, extreme, flood, variability, basin"
"1461";"Flood risk (d)evolution: Disentangling key drivers of flood risk change with a retro-model experiment";"Andreas Paul Zischg and Patrick Hofer and Markus Mosimann and Veronika Eva R{\"o";"Flood risks are dynamically changing over time. Over decades and centuries, the main drivers for flood risk change are influenced either by perturbations or slow alterations in the natural environment or, more importantly, by socio-economic development and human interventions. However, changes in the natural and human environment are intertwined. Thus, the analysis of the main drivers for flood risk changes requires a disentangling of the individual risk components. Here, we present a method for isolating the individual effects of selected drivers of change and selected flood risk management options based on a model experiment. In contrast to purely synthetic model experiments, we built our analyses upon a retro-model consisting of several spatio-temporal stages of river morphology and settlement structure. The main advantage of this approach is that the overall long-term dynamics are known and do not have to be assumed. We used this model setup to analyse the temporal evolution of the flood risk, for an ex-post evaluation of the key drivers of change, and for analysing possible alternative pathways for flood risk evolution under different governance settings. We showed that in the study region the construction of lateral levees and the consecutive river incision are the main drivers for decreasing flood risks over the last century. A rebound effect in flood risk can be observed following an increase in settlements since the 1960s. This effect is not as relevant as the river engineering measures, but it will become increasingly relevant in the future with continued socio-economic growth. The presented approach could provide a methodological framework for studying pathways for future flood risk evolvement and for the formulation of narratives for adapting governmental flood risk strategies to the spatio-temporal dynamics in the built environment.";2018;"flood, risks, drivers, change, evolution"

To study the variability, the monthly number of days with hail in northern Switzerland is modeled in a regression framework using large-scale predictors derived from ERA-Interim reanalysis. The model is developed and verified using radar-based hail observations for the extended summer season (April?September) in the period 2002?2014. The seasonality of hail is explicitly modeled with a categorical predictor (month) and monthly anomalies of several large-scale predictors are used to capture the year-toyear variability. Several regression models are applied and their performance tested with respect to standard scores and cross-validation. The chosen model includes four predictors: the monthly anomaly of the two meter temperature, the monthly anomaly of the logarithm of the convective available potential energy (CAPE), the monthly anomaly of the wind shear and the month. This model well captures the intra-annual variability and slightly underestimates its interannual variability. The regression model is applied to the reanalysis data back in time to 1980. The resulting hail day time series shows an increase of the number of hail days per month, which is (in the model) related to an increase in temperature and CAPE. The trend corresponds to approximately 0.5 days per month per decade. The results of the regression model have been compared to two independent data sets. All data sets agree on the sign of the trend, but the trend is weaker in the other data sets.";2018;"hail, variability, regression, temperature, trend"

"1467";"From global circulation to local flood loss: Coupling models across the scales";"Guido Felder and Juan Jos{'e";"Comprehensive flood risk modeling is crucial for understanding, assessing, and mitigating flood risk. Modeling extreme events is a well-established practice in the atmospheric and hydrological sciences and in the insurance industry. Several specialized models are used to research extreme events including atmospheric circulation models, hydrological models, hydrodynamic models, and damage and loss models. Although these model types are well established, and coupling two to three of these models has been successful, no assessment of a full and comprehensive model chain from the atmospheric to local scale flood loss models has been conducted. The present study introduces a model chain setup incorporating a GCM/RCM to model atmospheric processes, a hydrological model to estimate the catchment?s runoff reaction to precipitation inputs, a hydrodynamic model to identify flood-affected areas, and a damage and loss model to estimate flood losses. Such coupling requires building interfaces between the individual models that are coherent in terms of spatial and temporal resolution and therefore calls for several pre- and post-processing steps for the individual models as well as for a computationally efficient strategy to identify and model extreme events. The results show that a coupled model chain allows for good representation of runoff for both longterm runoff characteristics and extreme events, provided a bias correction on precipitation input is applied. While the presented approach for deriving loss estimations for particular extreme events leads to reasonable results, two issues have been identified that need to be considered in further applications: (i) the identification of extreme events in long-term GCM simulations for downscaling and (ii) the representativeness of the vulnerability functions for local conditions.";2018;"flood, risk, modeling, extreme, events"
"1468";"Floodplains and Complex Adaptive Systems{--";"Andreas Paul Zischg";"Floodplains, as seen from the flood risk management perspective, are composed of co-evolving natural and human systems. Both flood processes (that is, the hazard) and the values at risk (that is, settlements and infrastructure built in hazardous areas) are dynamically changing over time and influence each other. These changes influence future risk pathways. The co-evolution of all of these drivers for changes in flood risk could lead to emergent behavior. Hence, complexity theory and systems science can provide a sound theoretical framework for flood risk management in the 21st century. This review aims at providing an entry point for modelers in flood risk research to consider floodplains as complex adaptive systems. For the systems science community, the actual problems and approaches in the flood risk research community are summarized. Finally, an Outlook is given on potential future coupled component modeling approaches that aims at bringing together both disciplines.";2018;"floodplains, co-evolving, dynamics, complexity, systems"

The storm persisted for several hours and produced large hail resulting in significant damage. Storms of comparable severity occur on average only three times per year within the entire Swiss radar domain, but are rare events at this exact location, according to a set of over 400,000 automatically identified storms. A multitude of datasets, partly novel for central Europe, is now available to study the storm in great detail capturing its impacts, severity and development. The data we use include radar-based hail products, crowd-sourced hail reports, and insurance loss data. These independent datasets permitted a verification of both hail occurrence and hail size estimations by radar. The crowd-sourced reports agree well with radar-based hail observations and insurance data. Model data (ERA-Interim reanalysis, regional COSMO-2 analysis and WRF simulations) and radio-sounding data showed, that conditions were favourable for thunderstorm development due to an unstable and moist atmosphere over Switzerland, brought about by an interplay of large-scale pattern and local processes. Advection ahead of a cold front west of Switzerland and local evapotranspiration lead to high lower-tropospheric moisture. The large-scale flow and topographically induced Alpine pumping resulted in strong directional wind shear, and contributed to the longevity and severity of this storm. The cold front was not relevant for the vertical lifting. Using model simulations with very high resolution, we identified mountain wind systems and cold-air outflow as possible triggering and propagation mechanisms of this hail storm.";2018;"hail storm, severe, radar data, thunderstorm, topography"

In this study, we explore the sensitivity of flood loss estimates obtained in such micro-scale analyses to the spatial representation of the buildings in the 2D flood inundation model and to the hazard attribution methods in the flood loss model. The results show that building representation has a limited effect on the exposure values (i.e. the number of elements at risk), but can have a significant impact on the hazard values attributed to the buildings. On the other hand, the two methods for hazard attribution tested in this work result in remarkably different flood loss estimates. The sensitivity of the predicted flood losses to the attribution method is comparable to the one associated with the vulnerability curve. The findings highlight the need for incorporating these sources of uncertainty into microscale flood risk prediction methodologies.";2018;"modelling, urban, flood, sensitivity, uncertainty"
"1473";"Observations for Reanalyses";"Stefan Br{\"o";"Global dynamical reanalyses of the atmosphere and ocean fundamentally rely on observations, not just for the assimilation (i.e. for the definition of the state of the Earth-system components), but also in many other steps along the production chain. Observations are used to constrain the model boundary conditions, for the calibration or uncertainty determination of other observations, and for the evaluation of data products. This requires major efforts, including data rescue (for historical observations), data management (including metadatabases), compilation and quality control, and error estimation. The work on observations ideally occurs one cycle ahead of the generation cycle of reanalyses, allowing them to make full use of it. In this paper we describe the activities within ERA-CLIM2, which range from surface, upper-air and Southern Ocean data rescue to satellite data recalibration and from the generation of snow cover products to the development of a global station data metadatabase. The project has not produced new data collections. Rather, the data generated has fed into global repositories and will serve future reanalysis projects. The continuation of this effort is first contingent upon the organization of data rescue, but also upon a series of targeted research activities to address newly-identified in-situ and satellite records.";2018;"observations, reanalyses, efforts, data, cycle"

This also a?ects SSW events: Split SSW events tend to be preceded by anomalously eastward zonal phase speeds.

In recent years, flood inundation models have been remarkably improved and widely used for flood hazard simulation, flood exposure and loss analyses. In this study, we validate a 2D inundation model for the purpose of flood exposure analysis at the river reach scale. We validate the BASEMENT simulation model with insurance claims using conventional validation metrics. The flood model is established on the basis of available topographic data in a high spatial resolution for four test cases. The validation metrics were calculated with two different datasets; a dataset of event documentations reporting flooded areas and a dataset of insurance claims. The model fit relating to insurance claims is in three out of four test cases slightly lower than the model fit computed on the basis of the observed inundation areas. This comparison between two independent validation data sets suggests that validation metrics using insurance claims can be compared to conventional validation data, such as the flooded area. However, a validation on the basis of insurance claims might be more conservative in cases where model errors are more pronounced in areas with a high density of values at risk.";2018;"flood, model, validation, river, insurance"

We use the two concepts of institutionalization and commodification to analyze the significance of the increasing societal interest in interim housing. Contrary to housing squats, interim housing is a form of housing that went through a process of institutionalization. However, two different models of interim housing need to be distinguished. While non-commodified housing was historically developed to meet the needs of specific categories of tenants, commodified interim housing is managed on the owners? behalf. It is based on loaning contracts that require payment for operation costs but not rent. Consequently, the legal protection of the rights of interim users, namely low-income families, single parents, people with social aid and students, remains weak. To understand how these different models could emerge, we analyzed the motivations of different actors involved. Through the analysis of seven subcases in the metropolitan region of Zurich, Switzerland, the mechanisms that led to the diversification of institutionalized interim housing models will be assessed and discussed.";2018;"interim, housing, institutionalization, commodification, actors"

In winter, RWI events occur most frequently over the northwestern Pacific and less often over the North Atlantic. In summer, the total number of RWI events is lower than in winter and the North Pacific RWI region shifts toward the Tibetan Plateau. Composite analysis of the large-scale flow prior to, during, and after winter North Pacific RWI events shows an upstream wave train propagating across Asia on the Arctic waveguide prior to RWI. The composite wave forms on a relatively weak zonal jet streak, exhibits a baroclinic structure, and is strongly amplified by latent heat release in the warm conveyor belt of a deepening surface cyclone. Moreover, the wave forms in a region of large-scale upper-level deformation, upstream of a preexisting ridge. Further, active tropical convection affects the longitude where RWI occurs and thus acts as a geographical anchor for RWI. Individual RWI events are characterized by preferred combinations of these composite features: a strong surface cyclone tends to occur in concert with strong latent heating and a pronounced positive PV anomaly aloft. A second group of co-occurring features contains active tropical convection, a strengthened subtropical anticyclone, and the downstream ridge. These feature groups might be regarded as idealized archetypal RWI scenarios, although numerous intermediate events exist where features from both groups occur together.";2018;"rossby, wave, initiation, climatology, events"

To reinforce their position in situations of rivalrous land uses, planners can strategically use and combine different policy instruments in addition to standard land use plans.

This book not only presents how such instruments function, it additionally examines how public authorities strategically manage the scarcity of land, either increasing or decreasing it, to promote a more sparing use of resources. It presents 13 instruments of land policy in specific national contexts and discusses them from the perspectives of other countries.

In contrast to research striving for generalizable findings, TD research produces insights for a particular case and context. TD researchers, who build on other TD projects? results, need to know under what conditions knowledge gained from their case can be transferred to and applied in another case and context. Knowledge transfer between researchers and stakeholders is extensively discussed in the literature. However, a more profound understanding and management of the challenges related to knowledge transfer across cases, as it applies to TD research, are missing. We specify the challenges of knowledge transfer in TD research by distinguishing TD research for policy from conventional evidence-based policy, which relies on generalizing findings, such as randomized controlled trials. We also compare the functions that cases fulfil in other types of research that include basic, applied and ideographic research. We propose to conceptualize transferability of knowledge across cases as arguments by analogy. Methodologically, this would imply explicit consideration on whether the cases in question are sufficiently similar in relevant aspects while not dissimilar in other additional relevant aspects. On the one hand, this approach calls for explicit material considerations that are needed to learn about which aspects of cases are relevant. On the other hand, formal considerations on how to weigh perceived relevant similarities and dissimilarities of the cases at hand for transferability of knowledge, are needed. Empirical research on how projects in TD research deal with this problem is called for.";2018;"transdisciplinary, knowledge transfer, challenges, transferability, empirical"

We analysed the spatial organization of earthen embankments to infer the functioning of a landscape-level pre-Columbian Amazonian fishery that was based on capture of out-migrating fish after reproduction in seasonal floodplains. Long earthen weirs cross floodplains. We showed that weirs bear successive V-shaped features (termed ?Vs? for the sake of brevity) pointing downstream for outflowing water and that ponds are associated with Vs, the V often forming the pond?s downstream wall. How Vs channelled fish into ponds cannot be explained simply by hydraulics, because Vs surprisingly lack fishways, where, in other weirs, traps capture fish borne by current flowing through these gaps. We suggest that when water was still high enough to flow over the weir, out-migrating bottom-hugging fish followed current downstream into Vs. Finding deeper, slower-moving water, they remained. Receding water further concentrated fish in ponds. The pond served as the trap, and this function shaped pond design. Weir-fishing and pond-fishing are both practiced in African floodplains today.

We categorized the outcome of contracts aiming to reduce cattle grazing in riparian forest (n = 428) and deforestation (n = 912) by Bolivian farmers in terms of whether they were unsuitable, non-compliant, non-additional, or additional (the holy grail of PES programmes) and explored the relationship between farmers' reported motivations and the extent to which the conservation funded was additional. Up to 39% of contracts to exclude cattle, and 14% to prevent deforestation appear to be additional. Where participation is motivated by the instrumental values of nature (such as provision of clean water) contracts to exclude cattle from riparian forest are more likely to represent additional conservation.

At the same time, other ecosystem services such as water availability and quality and land stability have deteriorated. Environment-income analysis suggests that the point at which economic wealth feeds into effective environmental protection has not yet been reached for water resources. The study area is characterised by widespread non-stationary dynamics and slowly changing variables, declining resilience, and a growing probability of major system changes in the near future.

The nature of the relationship between loess accumulation and palaeoclimate at the core of the Eurasian loess belt is particularly poorly understood.  Here we reconstruct palaeoenvironmental change in Central Asia over the last 40 ky based on data from the Remizovka loess profile, in the northern foothills of the Tian Shan in southern Kazakhstan. Our interpretations are based on synthesis of chronostratigraphic, colour and magnetic susceptibility data, supported by chronostratigraphies from two additional sites nearby, Maibulak and Valikhanova. All three sites record substantially increased loess accumulation during late MIS 3 into the global last glacial maximum (gLGM). At Remizovka, increased loess flux occurred in two pulses at c. 38-25 ka and 22-18 ka, with the intervening period involving incipient pedogenesis. At Maibulak, two loess pulses at c. 40-30 ka and c. 28-22 ka are separated by a weakly developed paleosol which may date to the same time as pedogenesis at Remizovka. There is additional possible periglacial influence at Maibulak from c. 40?33.5 ka. At Valikhanova, there is some age overlap between paleosol and loess samples, but overall loess accumulation appears to have increased at c. 42-35 ka, c. 30 ka and the gLGM, with pedogenesis occurring {ensuremath{>";2018;"loess, centralasia, paleoclimate, palaeoenvironmental, chronology"

Our aim here is to understand whether century-scale shifts in the SWW also drive changes in atmospheric CO2 content. We report new multiproxy lake sediment data from southwest Tasmania, Australia, that show centennial-scale changes in vegetation and fire activity over the past 2400 yr. We compare our results with existing data from southern South America and reveal synchronous and in-phase centennial-scale trends in vegetation and fire activity between southwest Tasmania and southern South America over the past 2400 yr. Interannual to centennial-scale rainfall anomalies and fire activity in both these regions are significantly correlated with shifts in the SWW associated with the Southern Annular Mode (SAM; atmospheric variability of the Southern Hemisphere). Thus, we interpret the centennial-scale trends we have identified as reflecting century-scale SAM-like shifts in the SWW over the past 2400 yr. We identify covariance between our inferred century-scale shifts in the SWW and Antarctic ice core CO2 values, demonstrating that the SWW-CO2 relationship operating at a millennial scale also operates at a centennial scale through the past 2400 yr. Our results indicate a possible westerly-driven modulation of recent increases in global atmospheric CO2 content that could potentially exacerbate current greenhouse gas?related warming.";2018;"millennial-scale, shifts, southern, westerly, CO2"

Its use is expected to increase in the near future, which brings attention to the impacts of discharging thermally altered water into aquatic systems. Our review indicates that thermal discharge affects physical and ecological processes, with impacts recorded at all levels of biological organization. Many in situ studies found local effects of thermal discharge (such as attraction or avoidance of mobile organisms), while impacts at the scale of the whole water body were rarely detected. In complex systems, diffuse impacts of thermal discharge are difficult to disentangle from natural variability or other anthropogenic influences. Discharge of warm water in summer is likely to be most critical, especially in the context of climate change. Under this scenario, water temperatures may reach maxima that negatively affect some species. Given the diversity and complexity of the impacts of thermal pollution on aquatic systems, careful planning and judicious management is required when using lakes and rivers for extraction and disposal of heat. We discuss the drivers that influence the severity of potential impacts of such thermal use, and the options available to avoid or mitigate these impacts (such as adapting the operating conditions).";2018;"renewable, impacts, aquatic, planning, mitigation"

A land policy approach by means of a building obligation shall provide redress and has been introduced in two places in the course of the SPA-revision. A building obligation has been added as a condition for the extension of the building zone. Additionally, there is an explicit task for the existing building zone, the building obligation must be incorporated into the cantonal planning and building law and the municipalities shall be able to apply to it. Considering Rothenbrunnen GR as a specific practical example also reveals that it is not the actual application that matters but rather the applicability and that building land can be mobilised (even if indirectly) by means of a building obligation.";2018;"switzerland, land, policy, building obligation, development"
"1575";"An Empirical Perspective for Understanding Climate Change Impacts in Switzerland";"Paul Daniel Henne and Moritz Bigalke and Ulf B{\"u";"Planning for the future requires a detailed understanding of how climate change affects a wide range of systems at spatial scales that are relevant to humans. Understanding of climate change impacts can be gained from observational and reconstruction approaches and from numerical models that apply existing knowledge to climate change scenarios. Although modeling approaches are prominent in climate change assessments, observations and reconstructions provide insights that cannot be derived from simulations alone, especially at local to regional scales where climate adaptation policies are implemented. Here, we review the wealth of understanding that emerged from observations and reconstructions of ongoing and past climate change impacts in Switzerland, with wider applicability in Europe. We draw examples from hydrological, alpine, forest, and agricultural systems, which are of paramount societal importance, and are projected to undergo important changes by the end of this century. For each system, we review existing model-based projections, present what is known from observations, and discuss how empirical evidence may help improve future projections. A particular focus is given to better understanding thresholds, tipping points and feedbacks that may operate on different time scales. Observational approaches provide the grounding in evidence that is needed to develop local to regional climate adaptation strategies. Our review demonstrates that observational approaches should ideally have a synergistic relationship with modeling in identifying inconsistencies in projections as well as avenues for improvement. They are critical for uncovering unexpected relationships between climate and agricultural, natural, and hydrological systems that will be important to society in the future.";2018;"future, climate, impacts, observations, modeling"

"1589";"EGU 2018";"Pascal Horton and Stefan Br{\"o";"Statistical downscaling techniques based on a perfect prognosis approach often rely on reanalyses to infer the statistical relationship between synoptic predictors and the local variable of interest, here daily precipitation. Nowadays, multiple global reanalysis datasets are available. These are generated by different atmospheric models with different assimilation techniques and present various spatial resolutions. The context of the application of statistical downscaling might drive the choice of an appropriate dataset, for example when the archive length is a leading criterion. However, in many studies a reanalysis dataset is subjectively chosen, according to the user's preferences or the ease of access. The impact of this choice on the results of the downscaling procedure is rarely considered and no comprehensive comparison has been undertaken so far. The present work focused on the analogue method, which is a statistical downscaling technique. It relies on analogy in terms of synoptic-scale predictors with situations in the past to provide a probabilistic prediction for the day of interest. In order to quantify the impact of the datasets, ten different global reanalyses (NCEP Reanalysis I and II, ERA-Interim, NCEP CFSR, JMA JRA-55 and JRA-55C, NASA MERRA-2, NOAA-CIRES 20CR-2c, ERA-20C, and CERA-20C) were compared in seven variants of the analogue method, over 301 precipitation stations in Switzerland. Although all reanalysis datasets are usually assumed very good over Europe, significant differences in terms of performance of precipitation prediction were identified. The choice of the dataset can have a larger impact than the choice of the predictor variables. The impact of the reanalyses was found to increase with the complexity of the analogue method, when local variables are added, such as moisture, as compared to synoptic predictors, such as the geopotential height. As expected, the output spatial resolution of the reanalyses was found to have larger impact on local variables as well. Output resolutions below one degree were found to have generally limited to no benefit. Reanalyses with longer archives allow increasing the pool of potential analogues resulting in higher performances. However, when adding variables affected by errors in a more distant past, the skill decreased again.";2018;"statistical, downscaling, reanalyses, precipitation, impact"

They rely on the hypothesis that similar atmospheric conditions are likely to result in similar local effects. The statistical relationship is first defined (e.g. which predictors, and how many subsampling steps) and calibrated (e.g. which spatial domain, and how many analogues) before being applied to the target period, may it be for operational forecasting or for climate impact studies. A benefit of AMs is that they are lightweight and can provide valuable results for a negligible cost. AtmoSwing is an open source software that implements different AM variants in a very flexible way, so that they can be easily configured by means of XML files. It is written in C++, is object-oriented and multi-platform. AtmoSwing provides four tools: the Optimizer to establish the relationship between the predictand and predictors, the Downscaler to apply the method for climate impact studies, the Forecaster to perform operational forecasts, and the Viewer to display the results. The Optimizer provides a semi-automatic sequential approach, as well as Monte-Carlo analyses, and a global optimization technique by means of Genetic Algorithms. It calibrates the statistical relationship that can be later applied in a forecasting or climatic context. The Downscaler takes as input the outputs of climate models, either GCMs or RCMs in order to provide a downscaled time series of the predictand of interest at a local scale. The Forecaster automatically downloads and reads operational NWP outputs to provide operational forecasting of the predictand of interest. The processing of a forecast is extremely lightweight in terms of computing resources; it can indeed run on almost any computer. The Viewer displays the forecasts in an interactive GIS environment. It contains several layers of syntheses and details in order to provide a quick overview of the potential critical situations in the coming days, as well as the possibility for the user to go into the details of the forecasted predictand distribution.";2018;"analog, methods, software, forecasting, lightweight"

They may affect large fractions of observational datasets and remain largely undetected with standard data quality control. This study investigates the effects of such undetected data quality issues on the results of climatological analyses. For this purpose, we quality controlled daily observations of manned weather stations from the Central Andean area with a standard and an enhanced approach. The climate variables analysed are minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation. About 40â¯% of the observations are inappropriate for the calculation of monthly temperature means and precipitation sums due to data quality issues. These quality problems undetected with the standard quality control approach strongly affect climatological analyses, since they reduce the correlation coefficients of station pairs, deteriorate the performance of data homogenization methods, increase the spread of individual station trends, and significantly bias regional temperature trends. Our findings indicate that undetected data quality issues are included in important and frequently used observational datasets and hence may affect a high number of climatological studies. It is of utmost importance to apply comprehensive and adequate data quality control approaches on manned weather station records in order to avoid biased results and large uncertainties.";2018;"systematic, data, climatological, analysis, observations"

We adopt a wider conceptualization of social sustainability and propose an approach based on basic needs, capabilities and emancipation, environmental justice, solidarity and social cohesion. First, we identify indicators used in literature to capture social sustainability in human, animal and environmental health and propose ways to integrate them into a framework for the evaluation of One Health initiatives. Second, we formulate questions that can be used to evaluate the social sustainability of One Health initiatives. Third, we discuss the viability of operationalising the indicators, the trade-Offs that might arise and identify how they can be minimised.

Scientists tend to emphasise issues of environmental management. Based on our findings, we highlight the differences in the meaning of sustainable agriculture between the political and scientific discourses and attempt to explain them.

This study evaluated the influence of land use/management, landscape forms (slope/aspect) and soil types on soil organic carbon (SOC) which is a key soil quality indicator within a watershed of Wadi Beja in the northwest of Tunisia. Factor analysis based on Multiple Correspondence analysis (MCA) was used to visualize relativities between the selected factors. Surface (0?20 cm) soil samples were collected from four main LU/management types in the watershed (i.e., field crops, Permanent crops, plantation forest, grazing land) and at two aspects classes (north and south), 3 slope classes (flat, moderate and steep) and 7 different type of soils (Vertisols, Pedosols, brown calcareous, Isohumic, regosols and rendzinas). A soil spectral library was developed and used to assess the variation of the SOC across all the selected variables. A factorial analysis of variance ANOVA showed that all the variables significantly affected the soil organic carbon (SOC) levels. Under the grazing land use, the aspect, slope and soil types together affected significantly the SOC levels. Under the permanent crops land use, only the slope and the soil type affected significantly the SOC levels. Under the field crops, only the slope has a significant effect as well. However, in the forest, there is no significant effects of any of the selected variables on the SOC. The afforestation of the field crops with olive trees can significantly increase the SOC at different levels of slopes especially in vertisols and brown calcareous soils. Since 71 % of the area is field crops land use system includes 64 % of steep terrain under intensive monoculture, SOC level appear better in flat area compared to others. Regarding grazing lands, level of SOC was increased significantly in the flat and north facing areas particularly in brown calcareous soils. Soil fertility decline on sloping agricultural land poses a serious problem for the environment as well as for soil quality and productivity. In areas with highly erodible soils, such as those in steep slopes and south facing zones, application of soil and water conservation measures is crucial to sustain agricultural fields and to prevent or reduce soil degradation. There is strong indications that agroforestry have been successful in retaining soil fertility.";2018;"soil, management, landscape, carbon, agroforestry"

Land managers can sometimes prevent or mitigate the negative effects of disturbances through appropriate land management choices. In this study, we assess the contribution of land management practices (LMPs) to the resilience of eight Mediterranean forests and rangelands to multiple disturbances. The study uses a transdisciplinary approach, involving scientists, land managers, and local administrators. Data about disturbances, ecosystem services, the role of LMPs, and the resistance of LMPs to disturbances are combined using a semiquantitative index and analysed to evaluate how the LMPs implemented are suited to the disturbances affecting each study site. Our results indicate that the practices analysed are particularly effective in improving resilience of ecosystems against wildfires and torrential rainfalls. However, droughts are more difficult to address, and the examined practices were heavily affected by their occurrence. Tree planting appears to be highly affected by disturbances. Practices that selectively reduce the amount of vegetation appear to be beneficial in fostering recovery of ecosystems. Our assessment also suggests that it is particularly difficult to increase resilience to droughts and fires simultaneously. Practices that aimed to mitigate the impact of land use did not always prove valuable in terms of resilience. Finally, study sites that included efforts to address disturbances in their management objectives also displayed practices making the biggest contribution to resilience.";2018;"mediterranean, forests, land, management, disturbances"

We addressed this challenge by subdividing the study area into more homogeneous segments using several biophysical and socio-economic factors as well as spectral information. This was followed by unsupervised clustering within each homogeneous segment and supervised class assignment. Two classification schemes differing in their level of detail were successfully applied to four landscape types of distinct LULC composition. The resulting LULC map fulfills two major requirements: (1) differentiation and identification of several LULC classes that are of interest at the local, regional, and national scales, and (2) high accuracy of classification. The approach overcomes commonly encountered difficulties of classifying second-level classes in large and heterogeneous landscapes. The output of the study responds to the need for comprehensive LULC data to support ecosystem assessment, policy formulation, and decision-making towards sustainable land resources management.";2018;"land, cover, classification, segmentation, accuracy"

We translated pixel-level detected changes into neighbourhood-level changes that are useful to decision-makers. First, we identified pixel-level changes without and with type/direction of change, based on land cover maps from the years 1986 and 2010. For type-/direction-based characterization, we sorted observed transitions into four categories of prominent land change processes (?forest degradation?, ?deforestation?, ?afforestation?, and ?no change?). Adopting appropriate window sizes for identified ecoregions in the study area, we ran a focal statistics summation operator separately on the two change rasters (with/without consideration of direction of change). The results obtained by applying the approach can be described in relative terms as well as qualitative terms, using ranges of change values that can be further classified using qualitative terms, i.e. ranging from ?no change? to ?high/substantial change?. Our non-directional change assessment result showed that approximately 6% of the RAA is characterized by substantial change, whereas 40% appears stable (?no change?). Based on the directional-change assessment results, 3% of deforestation, 4% of forest degradation, and 3% of revegetation processes were found to constitute ?high/substantial change?. The types and intensity of landscape transformations display distinct spatial patterns linked to agroecological belts and socio-economic dynamics. Minimal reverse changes were observed on some severely degraded lands in the highlands, but the overall per cent cover remains relatively small. Overall, vegetation degradation still exceeds regeneration by more than half a per cent. Relatively lower altitudes and middle altitudes exhibit higher transformation. The presented approach and resulting outputs can provide planners and decision-makers with a synoptic view of land change processes. It can support policy formulation of sustainable land management and rehabilitation activities of the agricultural ecosystem at national and regional scales.";2018;"land change, ethiopia, synoptic, characterization, vegetation"

"1613";"Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Natural Hazard Science";"Margreth Keiler and Sven Fuchs";"European mountain regions are diverse, from gently rolling hills to high mountain areas, and from low populated rural areas to urban regions or from communities dependent on agricultural productions to hubs of tourist industry. Communities in European mountain regions are threatened by different hazard types: for example floods, landslides, or glacial hazards, mostly in a multi-hazard environment. Due to climate change and socioeconomic developments they are challenged by emerging and spatially as well as temporally highly dynamic risks. Consequently, over decades societies in European mountain ranges developed different hazard and risk management strategies on a national to local level, which are presented below focusing on the European Alps.  Until the late 19th century, the paradigm of hazard protection was related to engineering measures, mostly implemented in the catchments, and new authorities responsible for mitigation were founded. From the 19th century, more integrative strategies became prominent, becoming manifest in the 1960s with land-use management strategies targeted at a separation of hazardous areas and areas used for settlement and economic purpose. In research and in the application, the concept of hazard mitigation was step by step replaced by the concept of risk. The concept of risk includes three components (or drivers), apart from hazard analysis also the assessment and evaluation of exposure and vulnerability; thus, it addresses in the management of risk reduction all three components. These three drivers are all dynamic, while the concept of risk itself is thus far a static approach. The dynamic of risk drivers is a result of both climate change and socioeconomic change, leading through different combinations either to an increase or a decrease in risk. Consequently, natural hazard and risk management, defined since the 21st century using the complexity paradigm, should acknowledge such dynamics. Moreover, researchers from different disciplines as well as practitioners have to meet the challenges of sustainable development in the European mountains. Thus, they should consider the effects of dynamics in risk drivers (e.g., increasing exposure, increasing vulnerability, changes in magnitude, and frequency of hazard events), and possible effects on development areas. These challenges, furthermore, can be better met in the future by concepts of risk governance, including but not limited to improved land management strategies and adaptive risk management.";2018;"europe, mountains, hazard, risk, dynamics"

Especially in the context of climate change impact assessment, daily patterns of meteorological and catchment state conditions leading to flood events (i.e., storylines) may be of value. Here, we propose an approach to identify storylines of flood generation using daily weather and snow cover observations. The approach is tested for and applied to a typical pre?Alpine catchment in the period between 1961 and 2014. Five precipitation parameters were determined that describe temporal and spatial characteristics of the flood associated precipitation events. The catchment's snow coverage was derived using statistical relationships between a satellite?derived snow cover climatology and station snow measurements. Moreover, (pre?) event snow melt sums were estimated using a temperature?index model. Based on the precipitation and catchment state parameters, 5 storylines were identified with a cluster analysis: These are (a) long duration, low intensity precipitation events with high precipitation depths, (b) long duration precipitation events with high precipitation depths and episodes of high intensities, (c) shorter duration events with high or (d) low precipitation intensity, respectively, and (e) rain?on?snow events. The event groups have distinct hydrological characteristics that can largely be explained by the storylines' respective properties. The long duration, high intensity storyline leads to the most adverse hydrological response, namely, a combination of high peak magnitudes, high volumes, and long durations of threshold exceedance. The results show that flood generating processes in mesoscale catchments can be distinguished on the basis of daily meteorological and catchment state parameters and that these process types can explain the hydrological flood properties in a qualitative way. Hydrological simulations of daily resolution can thus be analysed with respect to flood generating processes.";2018;"flood, climate, precipitation, snow, storylines"

This presentation shows how governance processes are evolving to regulate competing multifunctional water uses under climate change in Oberhasli (BE), in the Swiss Alps. Our approach combines the frameworks of Institutional Resource Regimes (IRR) and Polycentric Governance. The IRR framework stipulates that formal institutional rules ? public policies and property rights ? shape the leeway that is available to resource users for defining localized resource-use modalities. Polycentric governance systems are those in which political authority is dispersed amongst a range of bodies that operate in overlapping jurisdictions which are not in a hierarchical relationship to one another. Recent scholarship suggests that polycentric organization of governance has a higher capacity to deal with complex challenges arising from climate change. The project aims to analyze under which conditions polycentricity can lead to a better coordination of resource uses. We performed a detailed case study to analyze governance processes of climate change mitigation and adaptation in Switzerland. Data were collected through 22 semi-structured interviews between 2016 and 2018 and document analysis. The results show that if the number of regulations increases and if simultaneously their coherence decreases, then this constellations promotes polycentric governance. The results further show the conditions under which polycentric governance improves or not the coordination of resource uses.";2018;"resource, regimes, governance, polycentricity, climate"

Although these acquisitions are enabled by favourable agricultural and investment policies, investors nevertheless generally negotiate directly with traditional authorities, often bypassing state authorities in the acquisition process. The strength of customary authorities is often attributed to the weakness of the state. Considering historical political precedents, this article argues that chiefs in fact increasingly derive their power and legitimacy from state and donor policy. Chiefs play a crucial role in translating the (inter)national investment and development logic into local customary settings which are characterized by complex and overlapping use rights to land and natural resources. Using data from an LSLA in Ghana?s Volta Region, this study shows how chiefs continuously redefine and adapt the customary land tenure system and its intricate governance logic to the globalized neoliberal policy setting, readily switching between different institutional settings (institution shopping) to legitimize their actions. Those whose rights under customary tenure are least secure are most likely to lose out in the process of institutional change from common to private property, while those with close connections to the customary elite are most likely to benefit from LSLAs.";2018;"ghana, land acquisitions, chiefs, customary, tenure"

Yet, capital cities play an important role in shaping the political, economic, social and cultural identity of a nation. As the seat of power and decision-making, capital cities represent a nation?s identity not only through their symbolic architecture but also through their economies and through the ways in which they position themselves in national urban networks. \"The political economy of capital cities\" aims to address this gap by presenting the dynamics that influence policy and economic development in four in-depth case studies examining the SCCs of Bern, Ottawa, The Hague and Washington, D.C. In contrast to traditional accounts of capital cities, this book conceptualizes the modern national capital as an innovation-driven economy influenced by national, local and regional actors. Nationally, overarching trends in the direction of outsourcing and tertiarization of the public-sector influence the fate of capital cities. Regional policymakers in all four of the highlighted cities leverage the presence of national government agencies and stimulate the economy by way of various locational policy strategies. While accounting for their secondary status, this book illustrates how capital-city actors such as firms, national, regional and local governments, policymakers and planning practitioners are keenly aware of the unique status of their city. The conclusion provides practical recommendations for policymakers in SCCs and highlights ways in which they can help to promote economic development.";2018;"capital, cities, economic, national, development"

McIntyre and Barbara Vogler and Ilias Chantziaras and Ana Cl{'a";"This chapter provides a conceptual framework describing the main ecological components of the global ecosystem, which need to be considered when using a One Health approach, including incorporating examples of metrics which both reflect the connectedness of different environments and quantify the complex interactions between humans, domesticated and nondomesticated animals and the environment in which they live, and the direct and indirect drivers which impact them. The set of ecological components described should be used to inform the audience on how to quantify the sustainability and thus the ?One Health-ness? of any environment. It is the quantification of an array of these components which demonstrate the ?added value? of One Health, through the savings of lives, improvements in life-lived (quality of life), qualitative gains and financial savings. One Medicine recognises that there is virtually no difference in the paradigm between human and veterinary medicine and both disciplines can contribute to the development of each other; animals should thus be positioned in the social and not the environmental realm, taking a ?less speciecist? stance. It should be understood that when quantifying the health of anything, be it an organism or an ecosystem, the variables measured are all context-dependent, particularly for ecosystem and environmental health. The interpretation of resulting measurements will differ dependent upon a human, an animal and ecosystem perspective, and each of these perspectives has ist own value, when thinking about ?One Health?. The environment is a major determinant of health with an estimated 25-33% of the global burden of disease attributed to environmental risk factors. Accordingly, when measuring the ecological dimension of One Health, account needs to be taken of the fitness and sustainability (including integrity) of the ecosystem and environment. This is not easy to quantify, as it results in the creation of indexes of heterogeneous variables, which do not provide an easily interpretable output of resilience. Various indices have been developed which aim to quantify environmental health, including: the long-term sustainability of different ecosystems; the state of the world?s biological diversity; describing the status of ecosystem services. Metrics to measure the health status of the world include the ?One Health-ness? of water, air, soil, biodiversity, and ecosystems. They require ecosystem approaches to health to factor in ecosystem interactions in health research. Methods to quantify the health status of populations under closer management of humans also need to be mentioned including those of humans, domestic animals, plants, and aquaculture. Finally, antimicrobial resistance issues across the ecological dimension should be considered. Many of these metrics are very ?humancentric? and should therefore be interpreted with caution. A major challenge for mankind to achieving a One Health in the future is to examine the trade-off from producing food and look for synergies with food quality for both animals and humans but also related to zoonoses emergence. Contaminants, including biological such as pathogens, chemical elements or compounds need to be identified and acted upon. Balancing all ecological components (water, air, soil, biodiversity) is critically important for food security, and both food safety and Food security should be interlinked for a One Health approach to sustained global food security. It is critical that a focus on food quality is not just on outcomes such as food nutrients or food safety (e.g. maximum residue levels) but also on how one-health-ness interacts with the food system at different stages of the value chain (production, processing, transport and consumption of food) to affect food quality. Given the growing human population, a set of One Health indicators which capture the link between human health, animal health and ecological health is to inform future global developments, particularly as we enter a period of unprecedented anthropogenic influence on global ecosystems.";2018;"ecological, one health, metrics, sustainability, environment"

In order to extract this information we used a multi-methodological approach in the Upper Paleolithic site of Krems-Wachtberg East in Lower Austria. Detailed field studies and high-resolution geochemical, colorimetric, and granulometric analyses help to understand the interplay between soil formation, loess accumulation, and surface processes. In comparison to the main profile/excavation of Krems-Wachtberg 2005?2015 it can be stated that OSL- and 14C-ages as well as the (archeological) stratigraphy of both profiles are comparable. However, pedogenic features are more evident at Krems-Wachtberg East. The new investigations show that well-established weathering indices do not clearly trace interstadial soil formation in the studied profile. Apart from this fact, single specific elements like Fe and Mg react more sensitive to initial pedogenic processes. Weak pedogenesis can further be evidenced by quantitative spectrophotometric results. The latter is also capable of refining and supporting the stratigraphy/pedology based on field analyses. As a general rule, next to loess also initial soil horizons of the MIS 3 are remarkably rich in primary carbonates indicating that soil formation took place in an alkaline environment. Due to the fact that hydrolysis of feldspars could not clearly be detected by the application of pedochemical indices, soil formation was probably limited to the oxidation of iron bearing minerals and weak carbonate leaching. These phases of favorable climatic conditions in terms of pedogenesis were terminated by increasing dust input towards the onset of MIS 2. The eolian deposits are overprinted during reducing conditions in soils and/or modified by colluvial processes. Altogether, weak pedogenesis can be reliably detected using a multi-methodological approach which leads to enhanced paleoenvironmental interpretations.

Hegerl";"Model simulations and proxy-based reconstructions are the main tools for quantifying pre-instrumental climate variations. For some metrics such as Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures, there is remarkable agreement between models and reconstructions. For other diagnostics, such as the regional response to volcanic eruptions, or hemispheric temperature differences, substantial disagreements between data and models have been reported. Here, we assess the potential sources of these discrepancies by comparing 1000-year hemispheric temperature reconstructions based on real-world paleoclimate proxies with climate-model-based pseudoproxies. These pseudoproxy experiments (PPE) indicate that noise inherent in proxy records and the unequal spatial distribution of proxy data are the key factors in explaining the data-model differences. For example, lower inter-hemispheric correlations in reconstructions can be fully accounted for by these factors in the PPE. Noise and data sampling also partly explain the reduced amplitude of the response to external forcing in reconstructions compared to models. For other metrics, such as inter-hemispheric differences, some, although reduced, discrepancy remains. Our results suggest that improving proxy data quality and spatial coverage is the key factor to increase the quality of future climate reconstructions, while the total number of proxy records and reconstruction methodology play a smaller role.";2018;"simulations, reconstructions, discrepancies, proxies, noise"

We describe a process through which university students at all levels learn how to handle complex, real-world problems. We argue that the ability to frame complex problems and the ability to empathize with diverse points-of-view are key skills for transdisciplinary learning and research. Competence fields are identified by reflecting on the actual skills needed for conducting a transdisciplinary research process and by identifying elements from past teaching experiences that have proven to be effective. We then develop a framework which shows how these competence fields link different learning domains, so that students develop not only cognitive, but also affective and psychomotor abilities. This framework may serve as a starting point for the design of other courses aimed at training transdisciplinarians.";2018;"sustainable, development, transdisciplinary, skills, curriculum"

The study found widespread occurrences of gender discrimination in the day-to-day practice of leadership, and that gender made a difference for wildland firefighters? experiences of normative workplace culture. In their practice of leadership, participants described a trade-off between gender diversity and excellence.

This study intercompares the representation of these features in 10 reanalyses and in an ensemble of 30 climate model simulations between 1980 and 2005. Both modern, full-input reanalyses and century-long, surface-input reanalyses are examined. Modern full-input reanalyses agree well on key statistics of blockings, cyclones, and circulation types. However, the intensity and depth of cyclones vary among them. Reanalyses with higher horizontal resolution show higher cyclone center densities and more intense cyclones. For blockings, no strict relationship is found between frequency or intensity and horizontal resolution. Full-input reanalyses contain more intense blocking, compared to surface-input reanalyses. Circulation-type classifications over central Europe show that both versions of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis dataset contain more easterlies and fewer westerlies than any other reanalysis, owing to their high pressure bias over northeast Europe. The temporal correlation of annual circulation types over central Europe and blocking frequencies over the North Atlantic?European domain between reanalyses is high (around 0.8). The ensemble simulations capture the main characteristics of midlatitudinal atmospheric circulation. Circulation types of westerlies to northerlies over central Europe are overrepresented. There are too few blockings in the higher latitudes and an excess of cyclones in the midlatitudes. Other characteristics, such as blocking amplitude and cyclone intensity, are realistically represented, making the ensemble simulations a rich dataset to assess changes in climate variability.";2018;"atmospheric, circulation, reanalyses, cyclones, blockings"

The primary focus is on determining the long-term temporal and seasonal changes in the flows of the Blue Nile in Ethiopia at the border to Sudan. This is important because the Blue Nile is the main tributary to the Nile river, the lifeline of both Sudan and Egypt. Therefore, to begin with long-term trends in hydrological time series were detected by means of both parametric and nonparametric techniques. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated using several sub-basins and new high-resolution land use and soil maps. Future climate change impacts were projected using data from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) of the National Centers for environmental Predictions based on three different climate change scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP3). Projected time series were analysed for changes in rainfall and streamflow trends. Climate change scenario modelling suggested that the precipitation will increase from 7% to 48% and that streamflow from the BNB could increase by 21% to 97%. The results provide a basis for evaluating future impacts of climate change on the upper Blue Nile River (Abay River). This is the main river basin contributing to the Nile and a source of water for millions of people in Sudan and Egypt, downstream from Ethiopia. Three models (CCCMA, CNRM, MRI) were applied in this research, within two future time periods (2046?2064 and 2081?2099) and one scenario (A1B). The Abay Basin was divided into seven sub-basins, six of which were used as inlets to the lowest basin at the border to Sudan. The above-mentioned results show that under current climate change scenarios there is a strong seasonal shift to be expected from the present main rainfall season (June to September) to an earlier onset from January to May with less pronounced peaks but longer duration of the rainfall season. This has direct consequences on the streamflow of the Blue Nile, which is connected to the rainfall season and therefore has direct effects on the people living in the sphere of influence of the Nile River.";2018;"hydrology, rainfall, climatic, blue nile, climate change"
"1664";"The effect of the Tambora eruption on Swiss flood generation in 1816/1817";"Ole Kristen R{\"o";"The Tambora volcano erupted in April 1815ccaused many direct and indirect impacts on the climate system, as well as ecosystems and societies around the world. In Switzerland, the eruption contributed to the 1816 ?Year Without a Summer?, which is considered to be a key factor in generating the highest flooding ever documented of the Lake Constance (7th July 1817) and the flood of the Rhine in Basel. Snow was reported to remain during the summer of 1816, which laid the basis for a massive snow accumulation in the spring of 1817. The meltwater together with a triggering event led to the reported flooding. We aim to create a hydro-meteorological reconstruction of the 1816/1817 period in Switzerland to verify and quantify the historical sources and place them into present-day context. We used an analogue method that was based on historical measurements to generate temperature and precipitation fields for 1816/1817. These data drove a hydrological model that covers the Rhine Basin to Basel. We reproduced the reported features of the hydroclimate, especially in regards to the temperature and snow storage. We showed that the snow storage in spring 1816 and 1817 was substantial and attained the magnitude of a recent extreme, snow-rich winter (1999). However, simulations suggest that the snowfall alone in the spring of 1817, rather than the enduring snow from 1815/1816, led to the meltwater produced from the snow pack that contributed to the flooding in Lake Constance and Basel. These events were strongly underestimated, as the triggering rainfall event was reconstructed too weak. Artificial scenarios reveal that a precipitation amount with a magnitude higher than the largest recent flood (2005) was necessary to generate the documented flood levels. We conclude that these Tambora-following flood events were a product of an adverse combination of extreme weather with an extreme climate.";2018;"tambora, flood, reconstruction, climate, summer"

"1666";"Integrated approaches to health. A handbook for the evaluation of One Health";"Simon R. R{\"u";"Challenges calling for integrated approaches to health, such as the One Health (OH) approach, typically arise from the intertwined spheres of humans and animals, and the ecosystems constituting their environment. Initiatives addressing such wicked problems commonly consist of complex structures and dynamics. The Network for Evaluation of One Health (NEOH) proposes an evaluation framework anchored in systems theory to address the intrinsic complexity of OH initiatives and regards them as subsystems of the context within which they operate. Typically, they intend to influence a system with a view to improve human, animal, and environmental health. The NEOH evaluation framework consists of four overarching elements, namely: (1) the definition of the OH initiative and its context; (2) the description of its theory of change with an assessment of expected and unexpected outcomes; (3) the process evaluation of operational and supporting infrastructures (the ?OHness?); and (4) an assessment of the association(s) between the process evaluation and the outcomes produced. It relies on a mixed-methods approach by combining a descriptive and qualitative assessment with a semi-quantitative scoring for the evaluation of the degree and structural balance of ?OH-ness? (summarised in an OH-index and OH-ratio, respectively) and conventional metrics for different outcomes in a multi-criteria-decision analysis. We provide the methodology for all elements, including ready-to-use Microsoft Excel spread-sheets for the assessment of the ?OH-ness? (Element 3) and further helpful worksheets as electronic supplements. Element 4 connects the results from the assessment of the ?OH-ness? to the methods and metrics described in Chapters 4 to 6 in this handbook. Finally, we offer some guidance on how to produce recommendations based on the results. The presented Approach helps researchers, practitioners, policy makers and evaluators to conceptualise and conduct evaluations of integrated approaches to health and enables comparison and learning across different OH activities, thereby facilitating decisions on strategy and resource allocation. Examples of the application of this framework have been described in eight case studies, published in a dedicated Frontiers Research Topic (https://www.frontiersin.org/researchtopics/5479).";2018;"one, health, approach, evaluation, complex"

This variable often belongs to a spatial scale not resolved by the ESM. Here, using the linear model fitted by least squares, we regress monthly mean streamflow of the Rhine River at Lobith and Basel against seasonal predictions of precipitation, surface air temperature, and runoff from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. To address potential effects of a scale mismatch between the ESM's horizontal grid resolution and the hydrological application, the MOS method is further tested with an experiment conducted at the subcatchment scale. This experiment applies the MOS method to 133 additional gauging stations located within the Rhine basin and combines the forecasts from the subcatchments to predict streamflow at Lobith and Basel. In doing so, the MOS method is tested for catchments areas covering 4 orders of magnitude. Using data from the period 1981?2011, the results show that skill, with respect to climatology, is restricted on average to the first month ahead. This result holds for both the predictor combination that mimics the initial conditions and the predictor combinations that additionally include the dynamical seasonal predictions. The latter, however, reduce the mean absolute error of the former in the range of 5 to 12â¯%, which is consistently reproduced at the subcatchment scale. An additional experiment conducted for 5-day mean streamflow indicates that the dynamical predictions help to reduce uncertainties up to about 20 days ahead, but it also reveals some shortcomings of the present MOS method.";2018;"model, statistics, environmental, predictions, scale"

As instrumental measurements are typically short, lake sediment proxies of aquatic primary productivity (PP) are often used to extend the observational record of eutrophication back in time. Sedimentary pigments provide specific information on PP and major algal communities, but the records are often limited in the temporal resolution. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data, in contrast, provide very high seasonal (sub-varve-scale) resolution, but the pigment speciation is limited. Here, we explore a combined approach on varved sediments from the Ponte Tresa basin, southern Switzerland, taking the advantages of both methods (HSI and high performance liquid chromatography, HPLC) with the goal to reconstruct the recent eutrophication history at seasonal to interannual resolution.

In this paper, I argue that an analysis of the fast?growing transnational market of assisted reproduction has much to gain from economic geographies with their interest in the making of markets across borders and feminist economic geographers' engagement with how new forms of gendered and racialized divisions of labor intersect with particular economic, cultural, political, and social contexts.

"1677";"The affective economy of transnational surrogacy";"Carolin Schurr and Elisabeth Militz";"The booming business of global surrogacy has come to a halt: one surrogacy hub after the other has started to regulate the incremental flow of intended parents to the Global South hoping to fulfill their desire for a baby with the help of a foreign surrogate laborer. Thailand and Nepal have banned surrogacy altogether; India and Mexico insist on the altruistic nature of their surrogacy arrangements. As the drive for altruistic surrogacy suggests, the baby holds an exceptional position in many societies: ideas about the ?unique? maternal bond create public unease about the commercialization of babies in surrogacy markets. Drawing on economic sociology and theories of affect, this paper argues that multiple processes of affective attachment, detachment and reattachment shape transnational surrogacy journeys. Based on ethnographic fieldwork in Mexico?s surrogacy industry, the paper studies processes of commodification and decommodification in three instances of market-making: (1) the assignment of value and a price to reproductive laborers? bodies on the basis of affective postcolonial geographies of beauty; (2) the affective/effective organization of the market encounter through contracts and communication rules and (3) the detachment of the final ?good? of the baby from the surrogate laborer. Transnational surrogacy arrangements, the paper concludes, are always forms of partial commodification ? no matter whether they are framed as altruistic or commercial ? because processes of affective/effective attachment and detachment are fundamental for delineating the intimate boundaries of families that come into life with the assistance of the globally operating surrogacy industry.";2018;"surrogacy, affective, commodification, detachment, transnational"

We highlight a need for greater recognition, particularly by disaster management and response agencies, of uncertainty as a subjective experience for those living at risk. Embodied uncertainty is distinguished from objective uncertainty by the nature of its internalisation at the individual level, where it is subjective, felt and directly experienced. This approach provides a conceptual pathway that sharpens knowledge of the processes that shape how individuals and communities interpret and contextualise risk. The ways in which individual characteristics, social identities and lived experiences shape interpretations of risk are explored by considering embodied uncertainty in four contexts: social identities and trauma, the co-production of knowledge, institutional structures and policy and long-term lived experiences. We conclude by outlining the opportunities that this approach presents, and provide recommendations for further research on how the concept of embodied uncertainty can aid decision-making and the management of risks in the context of extreme natural hazards.";2018;"uncertainty, embodied, subjective, risk, natural"

The socio-economic status of most inhabitants improved significantly as a result of the ?quinoa boom?. However, it also caused severe disturbances in socio-ecological systems and posed challenges to resource governance by traditional indigenous institutions. This article focuses on the role of farmer cooperatives, in particular, and examines how their production rules may have mitigated some of the challenges associated with the quinoa boom. We assess the activities of cooperatives with the help of Elinor Ostrom?s Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and analytic tools such as the ADICO grammar (Attribute, Deontic, aIm, Condition, Or else) and the eight design principles. The key production rules of cooperatives are examined and compliance with these rules is estimated based on semi-structured interviews and a survey conducted with quinoa producers (n=305). We argue that the cooperatives successfully contributed to alleviate pressures on resources in a context where traditional authorities were challenged by new tasks associated with land grabbing and the crowding out of diversified agricultural activities. In conclusion, we argue that collaboration between traditional authorities and farmer cooperatives holds great potential for improving the governance and sustainability of socio-ecological systems in the region.";2018;"quinoa, production, cooperatives, governance, sustainability"

There is a serious problem of water pollution in central Dhaka, in the Turag-Tongi-Balu River system in Bangladesh with the river system being one of the most polluted in the world at the moment. A baseline survey of water chemistry and total coliforms has been undertaken and shows dissolved oxygen close to zero in the dry season, high organic loading together with extreme levels of Ammonium-N and total coliform in the water. Models have been applied to assess hydrochemical processes in the river and evaluate alternative strategies for policy and the management of the pollution issues. In particular models of flow, Nitrate-N, Ammonium-N and indicator bacteria (total coliforms) are applied to simulate water quality in the river system. Various scenarios are explored to clean up the river system, including flow augmentation and improved effluent treatment. The model results indicate that improved effluent treatment is likely to have a more significant impact on reducing Ammonium-N and total coliforms than flow augmentation, but a combined strategy would greatly reduce the pollution problems in the Turag-Tongi-Balu River System.";2018;"river, pollution, dhaka, models, management"

The split-window (SW) retrieval method is well-established, and the split-window coefficients (SWC) are the key elements of its accuracy. Performances of SW depends on the degree of SWC customization with respect to its application, where accuracy increases when SWC is tailored for specific situations. In the literature, different SWC customization approaches have been investigated, however, no direct comparisons have been conducted among them. This paper presents the results of a sensitivity analysis to address this gap. We show that the performance of SWC is most sensitive to customizations for specific time-windows (Sensitivity Index SI of 0.85) or spatial extents (SI 0.27). Surprisingly, the study highlights that the use of separated SWC for daytime and night-time situations has limited impact (SI 0.10). The final validation with AVHRR satellite data showed that the subtle differences among different SWC customizations were not traceable to the final uncertainty of the LSWT product. Nevertheless, this study provides a basis to critically evaluate current assumptions regarding SWC generation by directly comparing the performance of multiple customization approaches for the first time.";2017;"lake, temperature, satellite, sensitivity, validation"

Here, we explore the current and potential role of place-based research into informing global sustainability initiatives by assessing the strengths, challenges, and opportunities. We show that place-based research allows for a better understanding of global social?ecological dynamics, and that transformations towards sustainability are often triggered at the local scale through the co-construction of local solutions. We discuss that the very nature of place-based research can hinder its transferability because its global integration faces temporal, spatial and governance scale mismatches, and we identify some of the key challenges of scaling-up its findings. We highlight new opportunities to mainstream place-based research that are emerging from first, long-term networks of place-based research, second, new institutional research settings that contribute with conceptual comprehensive frameworks and capacity building tools, third, a global community of practice, and fourth, the concept of region as a bridge between local and global sustainability initiatives. We believe that the time is ripe to promote the role of place-based social?ecological research as a key contributor to achieve global sustainability goals.";2017;"global, sustainability, place-based, research, insights"

Evaluation of lysimeter data covering a seven-year period";"Simon Raphael Oberholzer and Volker Prasuhn and Andreas Hund";"Due to climate change, agricultural production in Europe will be challenged by higher temperatures and shifts in precipitation distribution that will give rise to frequent summer droughts. An adaptation of agricultural systems to these changes requires detailed knowledge of crop water use characteristics. This study aimed to evaluate the dynamics of evapotranspiration and water uptake in different crops under the typical edaphoclimatic conditions of Switzerland. Seven years (2009?2015) of high resolution lysimeter mass data including 70 lysimeter-by-year combinations were evaluated. The ?adaptive window and adaptive threshold ?-filter (AWAT) was used to determine evapotranspiration (ET), precipitation (P), crop coefficient (Kc) and water use efficiency (WUE). Additionally, FDR sensors installed in the lysimeter soil core allowed recording the temporal dynamic of soil water extraction. The evaluation comprised grain maize, silage maize, rapeseed, sugar beets, winter barley, winter wheat and temporary ley. The AWAT filter was successfully used to determine lysimeter P that was inserted in the lysimeter water balance equation to calculate daily ET. It could be shown that the peak of daily crop coefficient coincided with the time of flowering for all flowering arable crops. WUE?s lay in the range given by standard literature, but daily crop coefficients were clearly higher than proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) which is partially due to an oasis and border effect of the lysimeters. Years with limited water availability were characterized by a comparably low Kc. For example, rapeseed in 2011 and maize in 2015 showed substantially lower Kc values. In accordance with the reduced Kc, readily available water was totally removed down to soil depth of at minimum 0.85 m. The limited water availability led to significantly lower yields only in case of silage maize in 2015. These results show overall current water supply to be sufficient under Swiss conditions; however, if drought events like in 2015 become more frequent and even more intense, yield potential of typical Swiss arable crops will be limited by water availability.";2017;"climate, crop, water, Switzerland, adaptation"

"1721";"Bayesian spectral likelihood for hydrological parameter inference";"Bettina Schaefli and Dmitri Kavetski";"This paper proposes a spectral domain likelihood function for the Bayesian estimation of hydrological model parameters from a time series of model residuals. The spectral domain error model is based on the power-density spectrum (PDS) of the stochastic process assumed to describe residual errors. The Bayesian spectral domain likelihood (BSL) is mathematically equivalent to the corresponding Bayesian time domain likelihood (BTL) and yields the same inference when all residual error assumptions are satisfied (and all residual error parameters are inferred). However, the BSL likelihood function does not depend on the residual error distribution in the original time domain, which offers a theoretical advantage in terms of robustness for hydrological parameter inference. The theoretical properties of BSL are demonstrated and compared to BTL and a previously proposed spectral likelihood by Montanari and Toth (2007), using a set of synthetic case studies and a real case study based on the Leaf River catchment in the U.S. The empirical analyses confirm the theoretical properties of BSL when applied to heteroscedastic and autocorrelated error models (where heteroscedasticity is represented using the log-transformation and autocorrelation is represented using an AR(1) process). Unlike MTL, the use of BSL did not introduce additional parametric uncertainty compared to BTL. Future work will explore the application of BSL to challenging modeling scenarios in arid catchments and indirect calibration with nonconcomitant input/output time series.";2017;"spectral, domain, likelihood, Bayesian, hydrological"

Brokers, known as ?educational consultants?, are actively mediating this process. Findings challenge the ambivalent image of the broker. Rather profit and social orientation often intersect in work routines. Negative cases initiated the foundation of a business association. The analysis of the operation of this association serves as example how educational agents work to professionalize their business and respond to their ambivalent reputation.

Uncomfortably large discrepancies between vegetation-based summer temperature reconstructions (mainly based on pollen) and climate model results have been reported for the current interglacial, the Holocene. For the Mediterranean region these reconstructions indicate cooler-than-present mid-Holocene summers, in contrast with expectations based on climate models and long-term changes in summer insolation. We present new quantitative and replicated Holocene summer temperature reconstructions based on fossil chironomid midges from the northern central Mediterranean region. The Holocene thermal maximum is reconstructed 9,000?5,000-years ago and estimated to have been 1?2-?C warmer in mean July temperature than the recent pre-industrial period, consistent with glacier and marine records, and with transient climate model runs. This combined evidence implies that widely used pollen-based summer temperature reconstructions in the Mediterranean area are significantly biased by precipitation or other forcings such as early land use. Our interpretation can resolve the previous discrepancy between climate models and quantitative palaeotemperature records for millennial-scale Holocene summer temperature trends in the Mediterranean region. It also suggests that pollen-based evidence for cool mid-Holocene summers in other semi-arid to arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere may have to be reconsidered, with potential implications for global-scale reconstructions.";2017;"climate, reconstruction, temperature, Holocene, Mediterranean"

Daw and Toby A. Gardner and Berta Mart{'i";"The emerging discipline of sustainability science is focused explicitly on the dynamic interactions between nature and society and is committed to research that spans multiple scales and can support transitions toward greater sustainability. Because a growing body of place-based social-ecological sustainability research (PBSESR) has emerged in recent decades, there is a growing need to understand better how to maximize the effectiveness of this work. The Programme on Ecosystem Change and Society (PECS) provides a unique opportunity for synthesizing insights gained from this research community on key features that may contribute to the relative success of PBSESR. We surveyed the leaders of PECS-affiliated projects using a combination of open, closed, and semistructured questions to identify which features of a research project are perceived to contribute to successful research design and implementation. We assessed six types of research features: problem orientation, research team, and contextual, conceptual, methodological, and evaluative features. We examined the desirable and undesirable aspects of each feature, the enabling factors and obstacles associated with project implementation, and asked respondents to assess the performance of their own projects in relation to these features. Responses were obtained from 25 projects working in 42 social-ecological study cases within 25 countries. Factors that contribute to the overall success of PBSESR included: explicitly addressing integrated social-ecological systems; a focus on solution- and transformation-oriented research; adaptation of studies to their local context; trusted, long-term, and frequent engagement with stakeholders and partners; and an early definition of the purpose and scope of research. Factors that hindered the success of PBSESR included: the complexities inherent to social-ecological systems, the imposition of particular epistemologies and methods on the wider research group, the need for long periods of time to initiate and conduct this kind of research, and power asymmetries both within the research team and among stakeholders. In the self-assessment exercise, performance relating to team and context-related features was ranked higher than performance relating to methodological, evaluation, and problem orientation features. We discuss how these insights are relevant for balancing place-based and global perspectives in sustainability science, fostering more rapid progress toward inter- and transdisciplinary integration, redefining and measuring the success of PBSESR, and facing the challenges of academic and research funding institutions. These results highlight the valuable opportunity that the PECS community provides in helping build a community of practice for PBSESR.";2017;"sustainability, social-ecological, research, success, features"

A review";"Benjamin Bandowe and Hannah Meusel";"Nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (nitro-PAHs) are derivatives of PAHs with at least one nitro-functional group (-NO2) on the aromatic ring. The toxic effects of several nitro-PAHs are more pronounced than those of PAHs. Some nitro-PAHs are classified as possible or probable human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Nitro-PAHs are released into the environment from combustion of carbonaceous materials (e.g. fossil fuels, biomass, waste) and post-emission transformation of PAHs. Most studies on nitro-PAHs are about air (gas-phase and particulate matter), therefore less is known about the occurrence, concentrations, transport and fate of nitro-PAHs in soils, aquatic environment and biota. Studies on partition and exchange of nitro-PAHs between adjacent environmental compartments are also sparse. The concentrations of nitro-PAHs cannot easily be predicted from the intensity of anthropogenic activity or easily related to those of PAHs. This is because anthropogenic source strengths of nitro-PAHs are different from those of PAHs, and also nitro-PAHs have additional sources (formed by photochemical conversion of PAHs). The fate and transport of nitro-PAHs could be considerably different from their related PAHs because of their higher molecular weights and considerably different sorption mechanisms. Hence, specific knowledge on nitro-PAHs is required. Regulations on nitro-PAHs are also lacking. We present an extensive review of published literature on the sources, formation, physico-chemical properties, methods of determination, occurrence, concentration, transport, fate, (eco)toxicological and adverse health effects of nitro-PAHs. We also make suggestions and recommendations about data needs, and future research directions on nitro-PAHs. It is expected that this review will stimulate scientific discussion and provide the basis for further research and regulations on nitro-PAHs.";2017;"nitro-pahs, occurrence, transport, fate, regulations"

Frequent mineral P fertilizer applications can cause heavy metals to accumulate and reach undesirable concentrations in agricultural soils. There is particular concern about Cadmium (Cd) and Uranium (U) accumulation because these metals are toxic and can endanger soil fertility, leach into groundwater, and be taken up by crops. We determined total Cd and U concentrations in more than 400 topsoil and subsoil samples obtained from 216 agricultural sites across Switzerland. We also investigated temporal changes in Cd and U concentrations since 1985 in soil at six selected Swiss national soil monitoring network sites. The mean U concentrations were 16% higher in arable topsoil than in grassland topsoil. The Cd concentrations in arable and grassland soils did not differ, which we attribute to soil management practices and Cd sources other than mineral P fertilizers masking Cd inputs from mineral P fertilizers. The mean Cd and U concentrations were 58% and 9% higher, respectively, in arable topsoil than in arable subsoil, indicating that significant Cd and U inputs to arable soils occurred in the past. Geochemical mass balances confirmed this, indicating an accumulation of 52% for Cd and 6% for U. Only minor temporal changes were found in the Cd concentrations in topsoil from the six soil-monitoring sites, but U concentrations in topsoil from three sites had significantly increased since 1985. Sewage sludge and atmospheric deposition were previously important sources of Cd to agricultural soils, but today mineral P fertilizers are the dominant sources of Cd and U. Future Cd and U inputs to agricultural soils may be reduced by using optimized management practices, establishing U threshold values for mineral P fertilizers and soils, effectively enforcing threshold values, and developing and using clean recycled P fertilizers.";2017;"phosphorus, heavy, accumulation, soil, cadmium"

Such adverse effects are of particular concern in permanently stratified meromictic lakes. Yet little is known about when and how meromixis and hypoxia became established (or vanished) prior to anthropogenic impacts, or how human activities such as deforestation, erosion and nutrient cycling affected the mixing regimes of lakes. We used calibrated hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data in the visible and near infrared range from a fresh, varved sediment core taken in Lake Jaczno, NE Poland, to map sedimentary pigments at very high resolution (sub-varve scale) over the past 1700 years. HSI-inferred bacteriopheophytin a (bphe a, produced by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria) serves as a proxy for meromixis, whereas HSI-inferred green pigments (chlorophyll a and diagenetic products) can be used as estimators of aquatic productivity. Meromixis was established and vanished long before significant human disturbance in the catchment was observed in the late eleventh century AD. Under pre-anthropogenic conditions, however, meromixis was interrupted frequently, and the lake mixing regime flickered between dimixis and meromixis. During two periods with intense deforestation and soil erosion in the catchment, characterised by sedimentary facies rich in clay and charcoal (AD 1070?1255 and AD 1670?1710), the lake was mostly dimictic and better oxygenated than in periods with relative stability and a presumably closed forest around the lake, i.e. without human disturbances.

Major efforts are being made to implement soil and water conservation measures that counteract soil erosion and help secure vital ecosystem services. However, where and to what extent such measures have been implemented is often not well documented. Knowledge about this could help to identify areas where soil and water conservation measures are successfully supporting sustainable land management, as well as areas requiring urgent rehabilitation of conservation structures such as terraces and bunds. This study explores the potential of the latest satellite-based remote sensing technology for use in assessing and monitoring the extent of existing soil and water conservation structures. We used a set of very high resolution stereo Geoeye-1 satellite data, from which we derived a detailed digital surface model as well as a set of other spectral, terrain, texture, and filtered information layers. We developed and applied an object-based classification approach, working on two segmentation levels. On the coarser level, the aim was to delimit certain landscape zones. Information about these landscape zones is useful in distinguishing different types of soil and water conservation structures, as each zone contains certain specific types of structures. On the finer level, the goal was to extract and identify different types of linear soil and water conservation structures. The classification rules were based mainly on spectral, textural, shape, and topographic properties, and included object relationships. This approach enabled us to identify and separate from other classes the majority (78.5%) of terraces and bunds, as well as most hillside terraces (81.25%). Omission and commission errors are similar to those obtained by the few existing studies focusing on the same research objective but using different types of remotely sensed data. Based on our results, we estimate that the construction of the conservation structures in our study area in Eritrea required over 300,000 person-days of work, which underlines the huge efforts involved in soil and water conservation.";2017;"land, degradation, conservation, structures, satellite"

"1780";"The Affluence?Vulnerability Interface: Intersecting scales of risk, privilege and disaster";"Christine Eriksen and Gregory Simon";"This paper examines vulnerability in the context of affluence and privilege. It focuses on the 1991 Oakland Hills Firestorm in California, USA to examine long-term lived experiences of the disaster. Vulnerability is typically understood as a condition besetting poor and marginalized communities. Frequently ignored in these discussions are the experiences of those who live in more affluent areas. This paper seeks to more closely explain vulnerability at its interface with affluence. The aim is to challenge uncritical explanations of vulnerability. We also offer alternative ways of conceptualizing vulnerability as a material condition and social construct that acknowledges broader cultural, ecological, and economic conditions, which may offset, maintain or deepen true risk exposure. Drawing on in-depth interviews with residents and emergency service managers, the paper presents a suite of vulnerability categories that intersect to create two concomitant and competing conditions. First, vulnerability is variegated between households within communities, including those in more affluent areas. Second, household vulnerability is collectively altered, and oftentimes reduced, by the broader affluent community within which individual households reside. By paying closer attention to the Affluence?Vulnerability Interface the paper reveals a recursive process, which is significant in the context of building more disaster resilient communities.";2017;"vulnerability, affluence, interface, disaster, resilience"

It focuses on three post-fire studies of residents affected by bushfire to a point where the fire threat was imminent, and where perceptions of luck was an emergent, yet pivotal, theme during interviews in explaining outcomes of the events. Despite differences in the severity of residents? experiences in terms of exposure, duration, and loss of life and property, narratives of luck were common across the interviews. The study results both enforce and challenge dominant paradigms of luck as something that is simultaneously ?external? and ?out of control?. Using trust, hope and agency as axes of analysis, we argue that it is the act of infusing personal agency with the energy of trust and hope that is often expressed as ?luck? in post-event sense-making. This enables many residents to be forward-looking, and for the threat to be a transformative experience. It also provides opportunity for enhanced dialogue on risk communication.";2017;"bushfire, sense-making, luck, agency, risk"

Although the concept of the PMF is often applied, there is no consensus on the methods that should be applied to estimate it. In PMF estimation, the spatio-temporal representation of the probable maximum precipitation (PMP) as well as the choice of modelling approach is often not theoretically founded. Moreover, it is not clear how these choices influence PMF estimation itself. In this study, combinations of three different spatio-temporal PMP representations and three different modelling approaches are applied to determine the PMF of a mesoscale basin keeping the antecedent catchment conditions and the total precipitation amount constant. The nine resulting PMF estimations are used to evaluate each combination of methods. The results show that basic methods allow for a rough estimation of the PMF. In cases where a physically plausible and reliable estimation is required, sophisticated PMP and PMF estimation approaches are recommended.";2017;"pmf, estimation, spatio-temporal, pmp, modelling"

However, runoff processes are probably not stationary in the case of a probable maximum flood (PMF) where discharge greatly exceeds observed flood peaks. Developing hydrodynamic models and using them to build coupled hydrologic-hydrodynamic models can potentially improve the plausibility of PMF estimations. This study aims to assess the potential benefits and constraints of coupled modelling compared to standard deterministic hydrologic modelling when it comes to PMF estimation. The two modelling approaches are applied using a set of 100 spatio-temporal probable maximum precipitation (PMP) distribution scenarios. The resulting hydrographs, the resulting peak discharges as well as the reliability and the plausibility of the estimates are evaluated. The discussion of the results shows that coupling hydrologic and hydrodynamic models substantially improves the physical plausibility of PMF modelling, although both modelling approaches lead to PMF estimations for the catchment outlet that fall within a similar range. Using a coupled model is particularly suggested in cases where considerable flood-prone areas are situated within a catchment.";2017;"deterministic, stationary, pmf, hydrodynamic, coupling"

This is surprising given the fact that large-scale decommodification may be our best option for a post-growth transition so dear to many ecological economists. Based on Heinsohn and Steiger's theory of ownership, we seek to provide an institutional foundation to processes of (de)commodification. These two authors distinguish between ?property? and ?possession?, two bundles of rights generating different logics and consequences. We illustrate this approach with three cases taken from an advanced capitalist economy, Switzerland, showing how commodification and decommodification processes may appear together or vigorously oppose each other. Cooperatives, forests and municipal land are examples of (partial) decommodified assets that follow a logic of possession and are therefore more likely to be sustainable. It is high time that the study of decommodification becomes central to ecological economics.";2017;"commodification, decommodification, ownership, possession, sustainability"

Several variants of the method are evaluated, and their performance is analysed. As a test bed for the reconstruction, the PAGES 2k proxy database (version 1.9.0) is employed as a predictor, the HadCRUT4 dataset is the set of observations used as the predictand and target, and a set of simulations from the PMIP3 simulations are used as a pool to draw analogues and carry out pseudo-proxy experiments (PPEs). The performance of the variants of the analogue method (AM) is evaluated through a series of PPEs in growing complexity, from a perfect-proxy scenario to a realistic one where the pseudo-proxy records are contaminated with noise (white and red) and missing values, mimicking the limitations of actual proxies. Additionally, the method is tested by reconstructing the real observed HadCRUT4 temperature based on the calibration of real proxies. The reconstructed fields reproduce the observed decadal temperature variability. From all the tests, we can conclude that the analogue pool provided by the PMIP3 ensemble is large enough to reconstruct global annual temperatures during the Common Era. Furthermore, the search of analogues based on a metric that minimises the RMSE in real space outperforms other evaluated metrics, including the search of analogues in the range-reduced space expanded by the leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). These results show how the AM is able to spatially extrapolate the information of a network of local proxy records to produce a homogeneous gap-free climate field reconstruction with valuable information in areas barely covered by proxies and make the AM a suitable tool to produce valuable climate field reconstructions for the Common Era.";2017;"spatially, reconstructions, proxies, temperature, method"

Critically, decadal climate prediction relies on the skill of state-of-the-art climate models to reliably represent these low-frequency climate variations. We undertake a systematic evaluation of the simulation of the IPO in the suite of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) models. We track the IPO in pre-industrial (control) and all-forcings (historical) experiments using the IPO tripole index (TPI). The TPI is explicitly aligned with the observed spatial pattern of the IPO, and circumvents assumptions about the nature of global warming. We find that many models underestimate the ratio of decadal-to-total variance in sea surface temperatures (SSTs). However, the basin-wide spatial pattern of positive and negative phases of the IPO are simulated reasonably well, with spatial pattern correlation coefficients between observations and models spanning the range 0.4?0.8. Deficiencies are mainly in the extratropical Pacific. Models that better capture the spatial pattern of the IPO also tend to more realistically simulate the ratio of decadal to total variance. Of the 13% of model centuries that have a fractional bias in the decadal-to-total TPI variance of 0.2 or less, 84% also have a spatial pattern correlation coefficient with the observed pattern exceeding 0.5. This result is highly consistent across both IPO positive and negative phases. This is evidence that the IPO is related to one or more inherent dynamical mechanisms of the climate system.";2017;"warming, hiatus, ipo, sst, models"

Predictors are extracted from reanalysis datasets that often have a six hourly time step. For precipitation forecasts, the predictand often consists of daily precipitation (06h to 30h UTC), given the length of their available archives, and the unavailability of equivalent archives at a finer time step. The optimal predictors to explain these daily precipitations have been obtained in a calibration procedure with fixed times of observation (e.g. geopotential heigths Z1000 at 12h UTC and Z500 at 24h UTC). In operational forecast, a new target situation is defined by its geopotential predictors at these fixed hours, i.e. Z1000 at 12h UTC and Z500 at 24h UTC. Usually, the search for candidate situations for this given target day is usually undertaken by comparing the state of the atmosphere at the same fixed hours of the day for both the target day and the candidate analogues. However, it can be expected that the best analogy among the past synoptic situations does not occur systematically at the same time of the day and that better candidates can be found by shifting to a different hour. With this assumption, a moving time window (MTW) was introduced to allow the search for candidates at different hours of the day (e.g. Z1000 at 00, 06, 12, 18 h UTC and Z500 at 12, 18, 24, 30 h UTC respectively). This MTW technique can only result in a better analogy in terms of the atmospheric circulation (compared to the method with fixed hours), with improved values of the analogy criterion on the entire distribution of analogue dates. A seasonal effect has also been identified, with larger improvements in winter than in summer. However, its interest in precipitation forecast can only be evaluated with an archive of the corresponding 24h-totals, i.e. not only 6-30h UTC totals, but also 0-24h, 12-12h and 18-18h totals). This was possible to assess on a set of stations from the Swiss hourly measurement network with rather long time-series. The prediction skill was found to have improved by the MTW, and even to a greater extent after recalibrating the AM parameters. Moreover, the improvement was greater for days with heavy precipitation, which are generally related to more dynamic atmospheric situations where timing is more specific. The use of the MTW in the AM can be considered for several applications in different contexts, may it be for operational forecasting or climate-related studies.";2017;"analogue, forecasts, precipitation, moving, improved"

"1825";"EGU 2017";"Pascal Horton and Rolf Weingartner and Stefan Br{\"o";"The analogue method is a statistical downscaling method for precipitation prediction. It uses similarity in terms of synoptic-scale predictors with situations in the past in order to provide a probabilistic prediction for the day of interest. It has been used for decades in a context of weather or flood forecasting, and is more recently also applied to climate studies, whether for reconstruction of past weather conditions or future climate impact studies. In order to evaluate the relationship between synoptic scale predictors and the local weather variable of interest, e.g. precipitation, reanalysis datasets are necessary. Nowadays, the number of available reanalysis datasets increases. These are generated by different atmospheric models with different assimilation techniques and offer various spatial and temporal resolutions. A major difference between these datasets is also the length of the archive they provide. While some datasets start at the beginning of the satellite era (1980) and assimilate these data, others aim at homogeneity on a longer period (e.g. 20th century) and only assimilate conventional observations. The context of the application of analogue methods might drive the choice of an appropriate dataset, for example when the archive length is a leading criterion. However, in many studies, a reanalysis dataset is subjectively chosen, according to the user's preferences or the ease of access. The impact of this choice on the results of the downscaling procedure is rarely considered and no comprehensive comparison has been undertaken so far. In order to fill this gap and to advise on the choice of appropriate datasets, nine different global reanalysis datasets were compared in seven distinct versions of analogue methods, over 300 precipitation stations in Switzerland. Significant differences in terms of prediction performance were identified. Although the impact of the reanalysis dataset on the skill score varies according to the chosen predictor, be it atmospheric circulation or thermodynamic variables, some hierarchy between the datasets is often preserved. This work can thus help choosing an appropriate dataset for the analogue method, or raise awareness of the consequences of using a certain dataset.";2017;"analogue, precipitation, reanalysis, datasets, downscaling"
"1826";"EGU 2017";"Pascal Horton and Rolf Weingartner and Charles Obled and Michel Jaboyedoff";"Analogue methods (AMs) rely on the hypothesis that similar situations, in terms of atmospheric circulation, are likely to result in similar local or regional weather conditions. These methods consist of sampling a certain number of past situations, based on different synoptic-scale meteorological variables (predictors), in order to construct a probabilistic prediction for a local weather variable of interest (predictand). They are often used for daily precipitation prediction, either in the context of real-time forecasting, reconstruction of past weather conditions, or future climate impact studies. The relationship between predictors and predictands is defined by several parameters (predictor variable, spatial and temporal windows used for the comparison, analogy criteria, and number of analogues), which are often calibrated by means of a semi-automatic sequential procedure that has strong limitations. AMs may include several subsampling levels (e.g. first sorting a set of analogs in terms of circulation, then restricting to those with similar moisture status). The parameter space of the AMs can be very complex, with substantial co-dependencies between the parameters. Thus, global optimization techniques are likely to be necessary for calibrating most AM variants, as they can optimize all parameters of all analogy levels simultaneously. Genetic algorithms (GAs) were found to be successful in finding optimal values of AM parameters. They allow taking into account parameters inter-dependencies, and selecting objectively some parameters that were manually selected beforehand (such as the pressure levels and the temporal windows of the predictor variables), and thus obviate the need of assessing a high number of combinations. The performance scores of the optimized methods increased compared to reference methods, and this even to a greater extent for days with high precipitation totals. The resulting parameters were found to be relevant and spatially coherent. Moreover, they were obtained automatically and objectively, which reduces efforts invested in exploration attempts when adapting the method to a new region or for a new predictand. In addition, the approach allowed for new degrees of freedom, such as a weighting between the pressure levels, and non overlapping spatial windows. Genetic algorithms were then used further in order to automatically select predictor variables and analogy criteria. This resulted in interesting outputs, providing new predictor-criterion combinations. However, some limitations of the approach were encountered, and the need of the expert input is likely to remain necessary. Nevertheless, letting GAs exploring a dataset for the best predictor for a predictand of interest is certainly a useful tool, particularly when applied for a new predictand or a new region under different climatic characteristics.";2017;"analogue methods, precipitation, optimization, genetic algorithms, parameters"

The model was developed using the following procedures: (1) a high-pass spatial filter algorithm was applied to detect linear features, (2) morphological processing was used to remove unwanted linear features, (3) the raster format was vectorized, (4) the vectorized linear features were split per hectare (ha) and each line was then classified according to its compass direction, and (5) the sum of all vector lengths per class of direction per ha was calculated. Finally, the direction class with the greatest length was selected from each ha to predict the physical SWC structures. The model was calibrated and validated on the Ethiopian Highlands. The model correctly mapped 80% of the existing structures. The developed model was then tested at different sites with different topography. The results show that the developed model is feasible for automated mapping of physical SWC structures. Therefore, the model is useful for predicting and mapping physical SWC structures areas across diverse areas.";2017;"efficient, reliable, automated, physical, mapping"

At the same time, we have observed a fair number of counter-evidentiary studies, demonstrating several regions that do not thrive despite strong research universities or other patterns of development in the absence of research universities. However, they are based on case studies of individual universities or regions, and the findings currently cannot be generalized. Another set of studies that have challenged the effect of universities at the nationwide scale and demonstrated its disproportionately small impact of universities, but their scope is limited to spin-offs, patents, and license activities. In this article, we propose to investigate this subject more systematically by triangulating three methods: 1) national-scale regression models with Business Dynamics Statistics and National Establishment Time Series data, 2) a regional survey of IT and life science firms in four so-called ?second tier regions,? and 3) a microeconomic firm-level analysis based on interviews with founders of technology intensive firms. Furthermore, we test the roles of university beyond those explicit, direct measures of spin-offs and patents by analyzing the firm formation rate and firm growth rate at the regional level, as well as the sources of growth at the company level. All results point in the same direction: The research function of the university has been overstated, and the teaching function of the university has been underappreciated. These findings provide profound implications for the policy of regional development.";2017;"university, development, research, impact, regional"

Although the importance of climate change is generally acknowledged, its impacts are often not taken into account explicitly when planning development projects. This being due to limited resources, among others, this paper aims to propose a simple and low-cost approach to assess the viability of human activities under climate change. Design/methodology/approach ? Many human activities are feasible only within a narrow range of climatic conditions. Comparing such ?climate corridors? with future climate projections provides an intuitive yet quantitative means for assessing needs for, and the viability of, adaptation activities under climate  change. Findings ? The approach was tested within development projects in Pakistan, Peru and Tajikistan. The approach was shown to work well for forestry and agriculture, indicating positive/negative prospects for wheat in two districts in Pakistan, temperature constraints for maize in Peru and widening elevation ranges for walnut trees in Tajikistan. Practical implications ? Climate corridor analyses feed into the preparation of Local Adaptation Plans of Action in Pakistan. Originality/value ? The simplicity and robustness of climate corridor analysis allow for efficient analysis and communication of climate change impacts. It works when data availability is limited, but it can as well accommodate a wide range of complexities. It has proven to be an effective vehicle for mainstreaming climate change into adaptation planning.";2017;"climate, viability, analysis, adaptation, development"

Even with extensive management interventions in the landscape, wildfires will continue to impact upon some properties. Residents in wildfire prone areas need to prepare themselves and their properties. Studies have found cost is one of the main reasons there is a generally low level of preparation by residents. In this study, we quantify the cost for residents to prepare themselves and retrofit their property for wildfire in an intermix and interface community. We combine this with semi-structured interviews to identify limitations to preparedness and willingness to contribute to a shared cost scheme with local government. Wide variation in the level of preparedness was found for the five case study homes in the intermix area and the five in the interface area with intermix houses being better prepared than those at the interface. All buildings were found not to comply with any building standards for wildfire resilience, despite most being considered to have the highest level of wildfire exposure. The total up-fronts cost to prepare residents and their homes ranged from approximately $8500 to $47,000 with an average of $24,600. Based on these figures, the financial investment required was significantly higher than residents felt they were able to cover. Ultimately, the choice to live in a wildfire-prone area will always involve the acceptance of some risk, regardless of the construction of the property and preparedness of the household.";2017;"wildfire, preparation, cost, community, risk"

"1868";"Challenges to link climate change data provision and user needs - perspective from the COST-action VALUE";"Ole Kristen R{\"o";"The application of climate change impact assessment (CCIA) studies in general and especially the linkages between different actor groups typically involved is often not trivial and subject to many limitations and uncertainties. Disciplinary issues like competing downscaling approaches, imperfect climate and impact model data and uncertainty propagation as well as the selection of appropriate data sets are only one part of the story. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary challenges add to these, as climate data and impact model data provision and their usage require at least a minimum of common work and shared understanding among actors. Here, we provide the VALUE perspective on current disciplinary challenges and limitations at the downscaling interface and elaborate transdisciplinary issues that hamper a proper working downscaling interface. The perspective is partly based on a survey on user needs of downscaled data that was distributed among 62 participants across Europe involving 22 sectors. Partly, it is based on the exchanges and experiences gained during the lifetime of VALUE that brought together different actor groups of different disciplines: climate modellers, impact modellers, statisticians and stakeholders. We outline a sketch that summarizes the linkages between the main identified actor groups: climate model data providers, impact modellers and societal users. We summarize review and structure current actors groups, needs and issues. We argue that this structuring enables involved actors to tackle these issues in a more organized and hence effective way. A key solution to several difficulties at the downscaling interface is to our understanding the development of guidelines based on benchmark tests like the VALUE framework. In addition, fostering communication between actor groups ? and financing this communication ? is essential to obtain the best possible CCIA as a prerequisite for robust adaptation.";2017;"limitations, uncertainties, challenges, interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary"
"1869";"Identifying spatial clusters of flood exposure to support decision making in risk management";"Veronika Eva R{\"o";"A sound understanding of flood risk drivers (hazard, exposure and vulnerability) is essential for the effective and efficient implementation of risk-reduction strategies. In this paper, we focus on ?exposure? and study the influence of different methods and parameters of flood exposure analyses in Switzerland. We consider two types of exposure indicators and two different spatial aggregation schemes: the density of exposed assets (exposed numbers per km2) and the ratios of exposed assets (share of exposed assets compared to total amount of assets in a specific region) per municipality and per grid cells of similar size as the municipalities. While identifying high densities of exposed assets highlights priority areas for cost-efficient strategies, high exposure ratios can suggest areas of interest for strategies focused on the most vulnerable regions, i.e. regions with a low capacity to cope with a disaster. In Switzerland, the spatial distribution of high exposure densities and exposure ratios tend to be complementary. With regards to the methods, we find that the spatial cluster analysis provides more information for the prioritization of flood protection measures than ?simple? maps of spatially aggregated data represented in quantiles. In addition, our study shows that the data aggregation scheme influences the results. It suggests that the aggregation based on grid cells supports the comparability of different regions better than aggregation based on municipalities and is, thus, more appropriate for nationwide analyses.";2017;"flood, exposure, methods, analysis, spatial"

Nikolas Rose argues that new forms of liberal eugenics have replaced traditional state biopolitics. In the current bioeconomy, it is no longer the state but active consumers that make (racialized) reproductive choices. The market of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in Mexico serves as an empirical case to argue that the liberal eugenics practiced in this market recasts rather than replaces traditional state biopolitics. This becomes evident in (1) the racialized access to surrogacy programs in Mexico and (2) in giving higher value to white sex cells, while (3) devaluing the genetic traits of non-white women through the selection and classification processes of reproductive laborers. Analyzing the transnational geographies of surrogacy markets in Mexico, the article investigates how future bodies are whitened through biomedical practices and consumer choices that are shaped by and simultaneously reinforce (post-)colonial imaginaries of white desirability.";2017;"reproduction, liberal, eugenics, market, racialized"

This paper critically engages with these narratives about science and technology and introduces (postcolonial) science and technology studies (STS) as a perspective that challenges such binary ways of dealing with science and technology in development contexts.

Its warming rate was only recently matched by recent warming in the region. Unlike recent warming largely attributable to anthropogenic radiative forcing, atmospheric warming during the ETCAW was strongest in the mid-troposphere and is believed to be triggered by an exceptional case of natural climate variability. Nevertheless, ultimate mechanisms and causes for the ETCAW are still under discussion. Here we use state of the art multi-member global circulation models, reanalysis and reconstruction datasets to investigate the internal atmospheric dynamics of the ETCAW. We investigate the role of boreal winter mid-tropospheric heat transport and circulation in providing the energy for the large scale warming. Analyzing sensible heat flux components and regional differences, climate models are not able to reproduce the heat flux evolution found in reanalysis and reconstruction datasets. These datasets show an increase of stationary eddy heat flux and a decrease of transient eddy heat flux during the ETCAW. Moreover, tropospheric circulation analysis reveals the important role of both the Atlantic and the Pacific sectors in the convergence of southerly air masses into the Arctic during the warming event. Subsequently, it is suggested that the internal dynamics of the atmosphere played a major role in the formation in the ETCAW.";2017;"arctic, warming, dynamics, circulation, mechanisms"

By changing surface energy fluxes and hydrological conditions, changes in snow cover can alter atmospheric circulation and lead to remote climate effects. To document such multi-scale climate effects, atmospheric reanalysis and derived products offer the opportunity to analyze snow variability in great detail far back to the early 20th century. So far only little is know about their quality. Comparing snow depth in four long-term reanalysis datasets with Russian in situ snow depth data, we find a moderately high daily correlation (around 0.6?0.7), which is comparable to correlations for the recent era (1981?2010), and a good representation of sub-decadal variability. However, the representation of pre-1950 inter-decadal snow variability is questionable, since reanalysis products divert towards different base states. Limited availability of independent long-term snow data makes it difficult to assess the exact cause for this bifurcation in snow states, but initial investigations point towards representation of the atmosphere rather than differences in assimilated data or snow schemes. This study demonstrates the ability of long-term reanalysis to reproduce snow variability accordingly.";2017;"snow, climate, reanalysis, variability, correlation"

In this paper, we propose a new method to take into account the relationship between precipitation intensity (P) and air temperature (T) to account for potential snow accumulation and melt processes during the elaboration of design storms. The proposed method is based on a detailed analysis of this P-T relationship in the Swiss Alps. The region, no upper precipitation intensity limit is detectable for increasing temperature. However, a relationship between the highest measured temperature before a precipitation event and the duration of the subsequent event could be identified. An explanation for this relationship is proposed here based on the temperature gradient measured before the precipitation events. The relevance of these results is discussed for an example of Probable Maximum Precipitation-Probable Maximum Flood (PMP-PMF) estimation for the high mountainous Mattmark dam catchment in the Swiss Alps. The proposed method to associate a critical air temperature to a PMP is easily transposable to similar alpine settings where meteorological soundings as well as ground temperature and precipitation measurements are available. In the future, the analyses presented here might be further refined by distinguishing between precipitation event types (frontal versus orographic).";2017;"flood, method, temperature, precipitation, alps"

Land system science provides a framework for analysing the links between land use change and the resulting socio-environmental trade-offs. However, the evidence base to support the navigation of such trade-offs is often lacking, as information on land use cannot directly be obtained through remote sensing and census data is often unavailable at sufficient spatial resolution. The global biodiversity hotspot of north-eastern Madagascar exemplifies these challenges. Combining land use data obtained through remote sensing with social-ecological data from a regional level household survey, we attempt to make the links between land use and ecosystem service benefits explicit. Our study confirmed that remotely sensed information on landscapes reflects households? involvement in rice production systems. We further characterized landscapes in terms of ?ecosystem service bundles? linked to specific land uses, as well as in terms of ecosystem service benefits to households. The map of landscape types could help direct future conservation and development efforts towards places where there is potential for success.";2017;"deforestation, ecosystem services, land system science, trade-offs, Madagascar"

"1926";"Snow hydrology signatures for model identification within a limits-of-acceptability approach";"Bettina Schaefli";"Abstract Discharge simulation from snow-dominated catchments seems to be an easy task. Any spatially explicit precipitation?runoff model coupled to a temperature-index snow model generally yields simulations that mimic well the observed daily discharges. The robustness of such models is, however, questionable: in the presence of strong annual discharge cycles, small model residuals do not guarantee high explanatory power of the underlying model. This paper proposes a methodology for snow hydrological model identification within a limits-of-acceptability framework, where acceptable model simulations are the ones that reproduce a set of signatures within an a priori specified range. The signatures proposed here namely include the relationship between the air temperature regime and the discharge regime, a new snow hydrology signature that can be readily transferred to other Alpine settings. The discriminatory power of all analysed signatures is assessed with a new measure of their discriminatory power in the model prediction domain. The value of the proposed snow hydrology signatures and of the limits-of-acceptability approach is demonstrated for the Dischma river in Switzerland, whose discharge shows a strong temporal variability of hydrologic forcing conditions over the last 30-years. The signature-based model identification for this case study leads to the surprising conclusion that the observed discharge data contains a multi-year period that cannot be reproduced with the model at hand. This model-data mismatch might well result from a yet to be identified problem with the discharge observations, which would have been difficult to detect in a classical residual-based model identification approach. Overall, the detailed results for this case study underline the robustness of the limits-of-acceptability approach in the presence of error-prone observations if it is applied in combination with relatively robust signatures. Future work will show whether snow hydrology signatures and their limits-of-acceptability can be regionalized to ungauged catchments, which would make this model selection approach particularly powerful for Alpine environments.

"1930";"Climate Change Adaptation - an Upstream-downstream Perspective";"Thomas Kohler and Andr{'e";"Mountains are among the regions most affected by climate change and they provide some of the most visible evidence of this change such as melting glaciers. While climate change is a global process, adaptation must be based on local contexts, especially in mountain regions with their varied natural and socio-cultural setting and highly differentiated effects of climate change at short distance. The need for mountain-specific adaptation is also given against the background of the key ecosystem goods and services, which they provide to humankind such as freshwater, and which are likely to be affected by climate change. Adaptation has to take place under conditions of uncertainty, but there are options such as Payment for Environmental Services (PES) that allow action under these conditions. Moreover, acting under uncertainty is nothing new for mountain communities. Addressing the science-policy dialogue, we show how this dialogue has been institutionalised in both developed and developing countries, by presenting examples from Switzerland, Kyrgyzstan, and Uganda. We then argue that closing the data gap relating to mountain climates and existing adaptive action could strengthen the science-policy dialogue substantially. To conclude, we advocate the establishment of mountain climate change observatories and the inventorying of promising adaptive action; highlight the need for capacity development and exchange across governmental and non-governmental institutions including mountain communities; and propose a funding window for climate change adaption in mountains for countries in need.";2016;"mountain, climate, adaptation, ecosystem, uncertainty"

In data-scarce regions like Ethiopia, oftentimes, discharge or sediment load data are not readily available and therefore researchers have to rely on input data from global models with lower resolution and accuracy. In this study, we evaluated a model parameter transfer from a 100 hectare (ha) large subwatershed (Minchet) to a 4800 ha catchment in the highlands of Ethiopia using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The Minchet catchment has long-lasting time series on discharge and sediment load dating back to 1984, which were used to calibrate the subcatchment before (a) validating the Minchet subcatchment and (b) through parameter transfer validating the entire Gerda watershed without prior calibration. Uncertainty analysis was carried out with the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting-2 (SUFI-2) with SWAT-Cup and ArcSWAT2012. We used a similarity approach, where the complete set of model parameters is transposed from a donor catchment that is very similar regarding physiographic attributes (in terms of landuse, soils, geology and rainfall patterns). For calibration and validation, the Nash-Sutcliff model efficiency, the Root Mean Square Error-observations Standard Deviation Ratio (RSR) and the Percent Bias (PBIAS) indicator for model performance ratings during calibration and validation periods were applied. Goodness of fit and the degree to which the calibrated model accounted for the uncertainties were assessed with the P-factor and the R-factor of the SUFI-2 algorithm. Results show that calibration and vali- dation for streamflow performed very good for the sub-catchment as well as for the entire catchment using model parameter transfer. For sediment loads, calibration performed better than validation and parameter transfer yielded satisfactory results, which suggests that the SWAT model  can  be  used  to  adequately  simulate  monthly streamflow and sediment load in the Gerda catchment through model parameter transfer only.";2016;"hydrological, model, transfer, validation, sediment"
"1932";"Impacts of land management on the resilience of mediterranean dry forests to fire";"Matteo Jucker Riva and Hans Peter Liniger and Alejandro Valdecantos and Gudrun Schwilch";"Wildfires have always been a part of the history of Mediterranean forests. However, forests are not always certain to regenerate after a wildfire. Whether they do depends on many factors, some of which may be influenced by land management activities. Failure to regenerate will cause a regime shift in the ecosystem, reducing the provision of ecosystem services and ultimately leading to desertification. How can we increase the resilience of Mediterranean forests to fire? Our approach to answering this question was twofold: first, we reviewed the literature to investigate chains of processes that allowed forests to regenerate (which we label Regeneration Mechanisms, or RMs); and second, we assessed the impact of selected management practices documented in the WOCAT  database on these RMs. For the assessment, we evaluated the relation between the benefits and disadvantages of the land management practices on the one hand, and the hindering and supporting factors of the RMs on the other. We identified three distinct RMs that enable Mediterranean forests to recover, as well as the time frame before and after a fire in which they are at work, and factors that can hinder or support resilience. The three RMs enabling a forest to regenerate after a fire consist of regeneration (1) from a seed bank; (2) from resprouting individuals; and (3) from unburned plants that escaped the fire. Management practices were grouped into four categories: (1) fuel breaks; (2) fuel management; (3) afforestation; and (4) mulching. We assessed how and under what conditions land management modifies the ecosystem?s resilience. The results show that land management influences resilience by interacting with resilience mechanisms before and after the fire, and not just by modifying the fire regime.

"1933";"Scenarios of land system change in the Lao PDR: Transitions in response to alternative demands on goods and services provided by the land";"Christine Ornetsm{\"u";"Sudden and gradual land use changes can result in different socio-ecological systems, sometimes referred to as regime shifts. The Lao PDR (Laos) has been reported to show early signs of such regime shifts in land systems with potentially major socio-ecological implications. However, given the complex mosaic of different land systems, including shifting cultivation, such changes are not easily assessed using traditional land cover data. Moreover, regime shifts in land systems are difficult to simulate with traditional land cover modelling approaches. A novel simulation approach was employed that focused on simulating changes in land systems rather than focusing on land cover. With the CLUmondo model we simulated three scenarios of potential developments between the years 2010 and 2030 assuming different degrees of international market integration and sustainable growth objectives. Although all scenarios show a decline of shifting cultivation systems, the respective orientation of markets and land governance resulted in strongly different land change trajectories. The land system changes are strongly location dependent and different trajectories are found in different parts of the country. Some scenarios show clear elements of land sparing with intensification of land management in the valleys and re-growth of forest on sloping land. Other scenarios show elements of enhanced multi-functionality. The approach addressed methodological challenges in simulating land system regime shifts and complex mosaic landscapes while accounting for societal demands for different types of goods and services from land systems. The land systems approach allows a nuanced representation of different types of forests and agricultural systems such as shifting cultivation and commercial agricultural plantations. Simulation results contribute to a debate about desired future land use on the national scale including its environmental and socio-economic implications.";2016;"sudden, gradual, land, change, systems"

The extent of this in fluence depends heavily on hydro-climatic conditions in the upstream catchments. This study investigated the changes in blue and green water distribution and sediment yield in a meso-scale catchment in the Wet Wenya Dega agro-climatic zone in the upper Blue Nile basin, where the implementation of SWC measures has been documented for the last 29 years. We implemented the temporal and spatial variability of SWC in the form of terracing into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and modelled its in fluence on discharge and sediment load. Using the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting program (SUFI-2), we calibrated and validated discharge and sediment load with a 31-year data set from a sub-catchment (113 ha) and validated the model for the entire catchment (4818 ha) with a two-year data set. Modelling showed that discharge at the catchment level, and thus water availability for downstream stakeholders, did not change signi ficantly with the implementation of new SWC measures, but SWC could substantially reduce sediment yield. Two modelled SWC scenarios showed that with the implementation of SWC measures the average annual sediment yield of the study area could be reduced from 37 t/ha to 17 t/ha.";2016;"soil, water, sediment, yield, swc"

Meaningful assessment of soil erosion requires models that adequately reflect surface water flows. Various studies have attempted to achieve better modelling results by including multiple flow algorithms in the topographic length and slope factor (LS-factor) of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). The choice of multiple flow algorithms is wide, and many of them have been implemented in programs or tools like Saga-Gis, GrassGis, ArcGIS, ArcView, Taudem, and others. This study compares six different multiple flow algorithms with the aim of identifying a suitable approach to calculating the LS factor for a new soil erosion risk map of Switzerland. The comparison of multiple flow algorithms is part of a broader project to model soil erosion for the entire agriculturally used area in Switzerland and to renew and optimize the current erosion risk map of Switzerland (ERM2). The ERM2 was calculated in 2009, using a high resolution digital elevation model (2 m) and a multiple flow algorithm in ArcView. This map has provided the basis for enforcing soil protection regulations since 2010 and has proved its worth in practice, but it has become outdated (new basic data are now available, e.g. data on land use change, a new rainfall erosivity map, a new digital elevation model, etc.) and is no longer user friendly (ArcView). In a first step towards its renewal, a new data set from the Swiss Federal Office of Topography (Swisstopo) was used to generate the agricultural area based on the existing field block map. A field block is an area consisting of farmland, pastures, and meadows which is bounded by hydrological borders such as streets, forests, villages, surface waters, etc. In our study, we compared the six multiple flow algorithms with the LS factor calculation approach used in the ERM2. A GrassGis algorithm matches the current erosion risk map (ERM2) best, both statistically and visually; modelling results show water flow accumulation and concentration in areas where a ten year field mapping study documented many erosion events. The same field mapping data were also used to check the validity of soil loss predictions using the six different multiple flow algorithms.";2016;"erosion, models, algorithms, mapping, switzerland"

We use radiocarbon-dated terrestrial plant macrofossils to establish a sound chronology and palynological analyses to reconstruct the vegetation and fire history of the Lago Rogaguado area. The sedimentary pollen and spore record suggests that wetland and wooded savannah (Cerrado) environments occurred around the lake between 8100 and 5800 cal BP. Fire activity was high during this period and was probably connected to the dry Cerrado environments. The pollen evidence suggests early plant cultivation (Zea mays, Annonaceae and Cucurbitaceae) from 6500 cal BP onwards, which is significantly earlier than hitherto assumed for Amazonia. Gallery forests expanded after 5800 cal BP, when fire activity strongly declined. Forest expansion intensified around 2800 cal BP and continued until 2000 cal BP, when forest cover reached its maximum and fire activity its minimum. The late-Holocene forest expansion to the south and the decrease of fire activity may have resulted from a climatic shift to moister conditions (possibly a shorter dry season). New crops (e.g. Avena-type) or adventive plants (e.g. Rumex acetosella-type) document the impact of European economies after ca. 500 cal BP. Land use intensity remained rather stable over the most recent centuries, arguing against a collapse of settlements in response to the arrival of Europeans, as reconstructed from other Amazonian pollen records.";2016;"llanos de moxos, palynological, wetland, vegetation, fire"

We calculated a multidimensional poverty index (MPI) that includes three dimensions: education, health, and standard of living. Making use of the MPI?s decomposability, we analyse how much each of the different dimensions and its respective indicators contribute to the overall MPI. We find a marked reduction in the multidimensional poverty headcount ratio over the study period, regardless of how the indicators are weighted or how the deprivation and poverty cut-offs are set. This reduction is based on improvements regarding all indicators except cooking fuel and nutrition. We observe no significant reduction in the intensity of poverty, however; there are wide disparities between the country?s regions and between urban and rural areas. The proportion of poor people in rural areas is more than twice as high as that in urban areas.

This assumption was repeatedly expressed in recent years, ascribing the said motivation to the Gulf States in particular. However, it must be considered of hypothetical nature, as the few global studies conducted so far focused primarily on the effects of LSLA on host countries or on trade in virtual water. In this study, we analyse the effects of 475 intended or concluded land deals recorded in the Land Matrix database on the water balance in both host and investor countries. We also examine how these effects relate to water stress and how they contribute to global trade in virtual water. The analysis shows that implementation of the LSLAs in our sample would result in global water savings based on virtual water trade. At the level of individual LSLA host countries, however, water use intensity would increase, particularly in 15 sub-Saharan states. From an investor country perspective, the analysis reveals that countries often suspected of using LSLA to relieve pressure on their domestic water resources{--";2016;"lsa, water, land, trade, global"

We use these new data, along with additional records, to study regional changes in the mean temperature and extreme indices of heat waves and cold spells frequency and duration over the period 1874?2015. The records are homogenized using subdaily cloud cover observations as a constraint for the statistical model, an approach that has never been applied before in the literature. A case study based on a record of parallel observations between a traditional meteorological window and a modern screen shows that the use of cloud cover can reduce the root-mean-square error of the homogenization by up to 30% in comparison to an unaided statistical correction. We find that mean temperature in the southern Alps has increased by 1.4?C per century over the analyzed period, with larger increases in daily minimum temperatures than maximum temperatures. The number of hot days in summer has more than tripled, and a similar increase is observed in duration of heat waves. Cold days in winter have dropped at a similar rate. These trends are mainly caused by climate change over the last few decades.";2016;"southern alps, meteorological records, regional changes, homogenization, temperature increase, heat waves, cold spells frequency"

Studying them requires  long time series of both the QBO and climate variables, which has restricted previous studies to the past 30?50 years. Here we use the benefits of an existing QBO reconstruction back to 1908. We first investigate additional, newly digitized historical observations of stratospheric winds to test the reconstruction. Then we use the QBO time series to analyse atmospheric data sets (reconstructions and reanalyses) as well as the results of coupled ocean?atmosphere?chemistry climate model simulations that were forced with the reconstructed QBO. We investigate effects related to (1) tropical?extratropical interaction in the stratosphere, wave?mean flow interaction and subsequent  downward propagation,  and  (2)  interaction  between  deep  tropical  convection and stratospheric flow. We generally find weak connections, though some are statistically significant over the 100-year period and consistent with model results. Apparent multidecadal variations in the connection between the QBO and the investigated  climate  responses are consistent with a small effect in the presence of large variability, with one exception: the imprint on the northern polar vortex, which is seen in recent reanalysis data, is not found in the period 1908?1957. Conversely, an imprint in Berlin surface air temperature is only found in 1908?1957 but not in  the recent period. Likewise, in  the model simulations both links tend to appear alternatingly, suggesting a more systematic modulation due to a shift in the circulation for example. Over the Pacific warm pool, we find increased convection during easterly QBO, mainly in boreal winter in observation-based data as well as in the model simulations, with large variability. No QBO effects were found in the Indian monsoon strength or Atlantic hurricane frequency.";2016;"qbo, strong, intermittently, climate, effects"

While European cold periods in the 17th and 18th century have been assessed in detail, earlier cold periods received much less attention due to sparse information  available. New evidence from proxy archives, historical  documentary sources and climate model simulations permit us to provide an  interdisciplinary, systematic assessment of an exceptionally cold period in the 15th century. Our assessment includes the role of internal, unforced climate variability and external forcing in shaping extreme climatic conditions and the impacts on and responses of the medieval society in north-western and central Europe. Climate reconstructions from a multitude of natural and anthropogenic archives indicate that the 1430s were the coldest decade in north-western and central Europe in the 15th century. This decade is characterised by cold winters and average to warm summers resulting in a strong seasonal cycle in temperature. Results from comprehensive climate  models  indicate consistently that these conditions occurred by chance  due  to the partly chaotic internal variability within the climate system. External forcing like volcanic eruptions tends to reduce simulated temperature seasonality and cannot explain the reconstructions. The strong seasonal cycle in temperature reduced food production and led to increasing food prices, a subsistence crisis and a famine in parts of Europe. Societies were not prepared to cope with failing markets and interrupted trade routes. In response to the crisis, authorities implemented numerous measures of supply policy and adaptation such as the installation of grain storage capacities to be prepared for future food production shortfalls.";2016;"climate, societies, cold, 15th, impacts"

Much scholarship on food systems governance is non-empirical, while existing research is often case study-based and theoretically and methodologically incommensurable. This frustrates aggregation of evidence and generalisation. We undertook a systematic review of methods used in food systems governance research with a view to identifying a core set of indicators for future research. We gathered literature through a structured consultation and sampling from recent reviews. Indicators were identified and classified according to the levels and sectors they investigate. We found a concentration of indicators in food production at local to national levels and a sparseness in distribution and consumption. Unsurprisingly, many indicators of institutional structure were found, while agency-related indicators are moderately represented. We call for piloting and validation of these indicators and for methodological development to fill gaps identified. These efforts are expected to support a more consolidated future evidence base and eventual meta-analysis.";2016;"governance, food, systems, indicators, research"

Plans include assigning trigger points for action, roles for all household members, and alternate approaches should the original plan fail. Fire agencies advocate that residents write, practise and discuss these plans before the fire season. In this study we use a multiple-methods approach to examine the theoretical and actual application of bushfire survival plans in south-east Australia. First, we review agency advice regarding survival plans to determine the consistency, clarity and specificity of the advice. Second, an online survey of residents examines the relationships between types of plans, with the planned action during a wildfire, gender and past experience with fire. Finally, semi-structured interviews with residents who have experienced wildfire examine the reality of decision-making, triggers used for actions and the role of survival plans. The study concludes that: a) fire agencies provide clear and concise information around survival plans despite some variation between states; b) preparation of survival plans is limited by the same range of factors that limit the extent of overall wildfire preparedness; and c) without a written, discussed and practised plan, decision-making during a wildfire may be impaired with potentially fatal consequences.";2016;"bushfire, plans, residents, australia, decision-making"

The statistics suggest increased gender equality for women following the affirmative gender politics of the 1990s in a previously male-dominated workplace. However, we argue these statistics mask how some patterns of practice surrounding fire management continue to reproduce a gendered workplace. Turning to the concept of hegemonic masculinity, we explore the ongoing gendered assumptions of this workplace and identify those that prove most resistant to change around bodies, masculinity, leadership, and parenting. This focuses the spotlight on gender equity. The article considers respect of gender difference in relation to wider questions of mentoring, training and leadership.";2016;"gendered, dynamics, wildland firefighting, workplace, equity"

However, understanding what controls the global CH4 cycle remains a challenge, as many CH4 sources vary strongly on spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, measuring the isotopic composition of CH4 can provide valuable information to reduce uncertainties in the CH4 emission budget. Up till now, however, high precision measurements of CH4 isotopologues are scarcely available as they are limited to isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), which is generally a laboratory based technique. This PhD thesis is about the development, validation and application of a field-deployable, fully automated, liquid nitrogen free measurement platform, called TREX-QCLAS, capable of performing real-time, high precision analysis of ambient air 12CH4, 13CH4 and 12CH3D mole fractions and their relative isotope ratios {ensuremath{delta";2016;"ch4, isotopic, trexqclas, emissions, global warming"

It suggests that the recently arrived Eritrean refugees present a new actor within the translocal social field with whom the second-generation Eritreans have to renegotiate their relation. We argue that these encounters frame the second-generation Eritreans' positionality within the translocal social field and influence their identity and their affiliation towards Eritrea and Eritreans. We find that encounters between second-generation Eritreans and new Eritrean arrivals are crucial moments through which second-generation Eritreans form their hybrid identity. Thus, the paper contributes to the debate on identity formation of the second generation by adopting a translocal perspective and provides insights into the diversity in the Eritrean diaspora in Switzerland.";2016;"encounters, translocal, identity, eritrea, diversity"

"2027";"EGU 2016";"Pascal Horton and Rolf Weingartner and Charles Obled and Michel Jaboyedoff";"The Analogue Method (AM) aims at forecasting a local meteorological variable of interest (the predictand), often the daily precipitation total, on the basis of a statistical relationship with synoptic predictor variables. A certain number of similar situations are sampled in order to establish the empirical conditional distribution which is considered as the prediction for a given date. The method is used in operational medium-range forecasting in several hydropower companies or flood forecasting services, as well as in climate impact studies. The statistical relationship is usually established by means of a semi-automatic sequential procedure that has strong limitations: it is made of successive steps and thus cannot handle parameters dependencies, and it cannot automatically optimize certain parameters, such as the selection of the pressure levels and the temporal windows on which the predictors are compared. A global optimization technique based on Genetic Algorithms was introduced in order to surpass these limitations and to provide a fully automatic and objective determination of the AM parameters. The parameters that were previously assessed manually, such as the selection of the pressure levels and the temporal windows, on which the predictors are compared, are now automatically determined. The next question is: Are Genetic Algorithms able to select the meteorological variable, in a reanalysis dataset, that is the best predictor for the considered predictand, along with the analogy criteria itself? Even though we may not find better predictors for precipitation prediction that the ones often used in Europe, due to numerous other studies which consisted in systematic assessments, the ability of an automatic selection offers new perspectives in order to adapt the AM for new predictands or new regions under different meteorological influences.";2016;"analogue, method, optimization, genetic, automatic"

Such capital cities feature a specific political economy characterized by a strong government presence in its regional economy and its local governance arrangements. Bern has been losing importance in the Swiss urban system over the past decades due to a stagnating economy, population decline and missed opportunities for regional cooperation. To re-position itself in the Swiss urban hierarchy, political leaders and policymakers established a non-profit organization called ?Capital Region Switzerland? in 2010 arguing that a capital city should not be measured by economic success only, but by its function as a political center where political decisions are negotiated and implemented. This city profile analyses Bern's strategy and discusses its ambitions and limitations in the context of the city's history, socio-economic and political conditions. We conclude that Bern's positioning strategy has so far been a political success, yet that there are severe limitations regarding advancing economic development. As a result, this re-positioning strategy is not able to address the fundamental economic development challenges that Bern faces as a secondary capital city.";2016;"bern, secondary, capital, economy, strategy"

The Results indicate that (1) during critical incidents ? when perspectives clash ? actors use arguments to gain persuasion. (2) The data illustrates that independently of their hierarchical position  within  the  company, strategic actors show an equal distribution of argumentative techniques.";2016;"power, strategy, communication, persuasion, hierarchy"
"2043";"Introduction: the stickiness of emotions in the field ? complicating feminist methodologies";"Nicole Lalibert{'e";"This editorial theorizes the emotional entanglements that constitute spaces of fieldwork. Drawing on Sara Ahmed's notion of sticky and circulating emotions, we develop the concept of emotional entanglements as a way to engage with the methodological implications of the emotional turn in geographic research. Beyond providing empirical evidence for research on emotional geographies, we argue that an attention to emotions in fieldwork has the potential to reinvigorate feminist practices of reflexivity and positionality. In addition, a critical engagement with emotions can offer novel epistemological techniques for studying the politics of knowledge production and the landscapes of power in which we, as researchers, are embedded. As the papers of this themed section demonstrate, analysis of emotional entanglements in research pose critical questions with regard to power relations, research ethics and the well-being of research participants and researchers alike. They also make visible how the power relations of sexism, racism, capitalism, nationalism and imperialism permeate and constitute the emotional spaces of the field. We use the notion of emotional entanglements as a way to situate the five articles of the themed section and to highlight the contribution of each paper to debates about the emotional field.";2016;"emotional, entanglements, fieldwork, geography, power"

Markovi{'c";"The loess-paleosol sequences of the Danube basin contain the longest and most complete terrestrial records of Middle and Late Pleistocene paleoclimates in Europe. Consequently it is no surprise that scientific research into European loess began in this region and has a long and distinguished history. European loess research was initiated by Count Marsigli in the Serbian Vojvodina in the late 17th century, formed the focus of the international Loess Commission which straddled both sides of the Iron Curtain from 1961, and culminated with George Kukla's seminal studies in the 1970s correlating the loess archives with deep-sea sediments. The rise in popularity of the longer Chinese loess sequences in the early 1980s shifted the international research focus away from Europe, and it was not until the change of century that scientific investigation intensified in the region ? this time with much more sophisticated tools for analysis.  Despite its potential as one of Europe's most valuable Quaternary archives, scientific research into Danube loess has until recently been hindered both by landscape heterogeneity and the large number of countries it covers. These have presented a major limiting factor in developing a unified research approach. For decades, regional/national loess stratigraphic models were defined separately. Difficulties in correlating such schemes persist, especially since these often change significantly with advances in dating methodologies. A cooperative effort is necessary to synthesize the available data, which requires not only the insights from but also the perspective provided by an appreciation of the history of the research.  In this study we present a critical historical overview of loess research in the Danube region. We classify the major research phases throughout the long tradition of Danube loess investigations into five categories: (1) the Early period (late 17th century until 1920) extending from Marsigli to Penck; (2) the Classic period (1920?1961) encompassing the contributions of Milankovi{'c";2016;"danube, loess, research, europe, history"

Building upon and extending these notions of the nation as represented and embodied, the paper argues that the nation also takes shape through bodily encounters and joyful as well as painful affections. In what we call ?affective nationalism?, the nation emerges in moments of encounter between different bodies and objects through embodying, sharing, enjoying or disliking what feels national. We combine a Deleuzian reading of affect that discloses the mechanisms of material becomings with feminist scholarship sensitive to how bodies affect and are affected differently by materially produced nationalisms. Based on ethnographic field research in Azerbaijan, which we present in three vignettes, we untangle the affective becoming of national bodies, objects and places during a publicly staged ceremony of the collective remembrance of martyr and the celebration of a national holiday within the realm of a family. The paper makes two contributions to researching affective nationalism. First, it enquires into how people identify with Azerbaijan through their capacities to affect and to be affected by what feels national and, second, it explores how affective nationalism can be captured through vignettes of affective writing.";2016;"banal, embodied, affective, bodies, objects"

Exploring the conjunctions and disjunctions between the two approaches, it proposes three cross?fertilisations that have implications for understanding three key processes in our socio?material world: stabilisation, change and affect. First, the conceptual vocabulary of ANT can enrich assemblage thinking with an explicitly spatial account of the ways in which assemblages are drawn together, reach across space and are stabilised. Second, each approach is better attuned to conceptualising a particular kind of change in socio?material relations: ANT describes change without rupture, or fluidity, whereas assemblage thinking describes change with rupture, or events. Third and last, assemblage thinking could fashion ANT with a greater sensitivity for the productive role of affect in bringing socio?material relations into being through the production of desire/wish (d{'e";2016;"assemblage, actor, network, spatial, affect"

Bradstock";"Wildfire has resulted in significant loss of property and lives. Residents can improve the probability of survival of structures and themselves by undertaking suitable preparation. Only a small proportion of residents adequately prepare for wildfire with monetary and time costs cited as significant impediments. Few studies have quantified the monetary and time costs for residents to prepare. Here we use an online survey to estimate the extent to which cost drives the probability of a resident undertaking preparatory actions. Cost was found to be a significant driver if preparatory actions were being undertaken primarily for wildfire, but not if the preparatory actions were partially or primarily for other purposes, e.g. landscape maintenance. Approximate average costs for a resident to prepare for wildfire was $AUD 10,000, with a subsequent annual maintenance cost of $AUD 1000. Largest costs were related to altering landscaping features, e.g. fencing, positioning of garden beds. The paper argues that risks from landscape features could be reduced through further development of guidelines or standards for building in fire prone landscapes. Overall, two primary factors were found to predict the extent of preparation of a resident ? planned future actions and their risk perception. Residents who intend to evacuate in the event of a wildfire are less likely to prepare than those that plan to stay and defend, which points to a problematic gap between official advice to prepare regardless of intended actions and public tendencies to only prepare if they intend to stay and defend.";2016;"wildfire, preparation, cost, risk, residents"

Remote areas of Ethiopia often lack adequate precipitation data and where these data are available, there might be substantial temporal or spatial gaps. To counter this challenge, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) of the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) readily provides weather data for any geographic location on earth between 1979 and 2014. This study assesses the applicability of CFSR weather data to three watersheds in the Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia. To this end, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was set up to simulate discharge and soil loss, using CFSR and conventional weather data, in three small-scale watersheds ranging from 112 to 477 ha. Calibrated simulation results were compared to observed river discharge and observed soil loss over a period of 32 years. The conventional weather data resulted in very good discharge outputs for all three watersheds, while the CFSR weather data resulted in unsatisfactory discharge outputs for all of the three gauging stations. Soil loss simulation with conventional weather inputs yielded satisfactory outputs for two of three watersheds, while the CFSR weather input resulted in three unsatisfactory results. Overall, the simulations with the conventional data resulted in far better results for discharge and soil loss than simulations with CFSR data. The simulations with CFSR data were unable to adequately represent the specific regional climate for the three watersheds, performing even worse in climatic areas with two rainy seasons. Hence, CFSR data should not be used lightly in remote areas with no conventional weather data where no prior analysis is possible.";2016;"rainfall, modelling, weather, discharge, soil"

Such information is often lacking. This paper describes statistics of mean and extreme precipitation in a unique data set from the Mount Kenya region, encompassing around 50 stations with at least 30 years of data. We describe the data set, including quality control procedures and statistical break detection. Trends in mean precipitation and extreme indices calculated from these data for individual rainy seasons are compared with corresponding trends in reanalysis products. From 1979 to 2011, mean precipitation decreased at 75% of the stations during the ?long rains? (March to May) and increased at 70% of the stations during the ?short rains? (October to December). Corresponding trends are found in the number of heavy precipitation days, and maximum of consecutive 5-day precipitation. Conversely, an increase in consecutive dry days within both main rainy seasons is found. However, trends are only statistically significant in very few cases. Reanalysis data sets agree with observations with respect to interannual variability, while correlations are considerably lower for monthly deviations (ratios) from the mean annual cycle.

"2083";"Rethinking the place of emotions in the field through social laboratories";"Carolin Schurr and Katharina Abdo";"The insights of feminist science and technology studies (STS) into the constructed and situated nature of knowledge have proved crucial to informing feminist geography. Since the rise of emotional geographies, feminist methodologies no longer simply reflect on questions of positionality, partiality, and power relations, but also on the role of emotions in the field. In this article, we argue that a feminist STS perspective has much to offer when thinking about the way emotions are engineered, controlled, and negotiated in research processes. Our engagement with what we call ?social laboratories? ? i.e., spaces in everyday life where (experimental) research is conducted with human beings ? advances debates in feminist geography, as these laboratories crystallize the emotional entanglements feminists encounter in the field. Looking at economic experiments in Ghana and fertility clinics in Mexico, we discuss the difficulties of doing feminist fieldwork in these experimental research spaces. We argue that the constant negotiation of emotions and ethics is crucial to access, assess, and do fieldwork in research settings that do not adhere to feminist ideals, but nevertheless have gendered effects on women?s and men?s lives. Rethinking ?the place of emotions in research?

"2091";"Loess: Rock, sediment or soil ? What is missing for its definition?";"Tobias Sprafke and Igor Obreht";"Loess is commonly defined as an accumulation of windblown silt. However, the complex mechanisms that are responsible for most of the structural characteristics of loess require a more precise explanation. The common definition of loess ignores a set of processes that start during and after the subaerial deposition of silt. The term loessification has been used by a number of authors to refer to the quasi-pedogenic/quasi-diagenetic processes that result in the typical aggregation of loess; however these mechanisms are rarely described in detail. Depending on the researcher's background, loess is classified as sediment, soil or rock. This review gives an overview on loess definitions through time and evaluates the main concepts related to loess formation. Several gaps of knowledge are identified that require a number of specific studies related to different aspects of loess formation in various environments. We propose to 1) differentiate primary loessification which initializes the formation of loess structure from secondary loessification which takes place subsequently and 2) define loess-like sediments as deposits that experienced loessification but were not transported aeolian. Mainly aeolian processes and loessification are of equal importance to define loess.";2016;"loess, formation, processes, definitions, aeolian"

In this study, maximum (peak) sustained wind speeds on a 3-km horizontal grid over Switzerland are obtained by dynamical downscaling from the Twentieth Century Reanalysis (20CR) employing the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Subsequently, simulated peak gusts are derived using four wind gust parameterizations (WGPs). Evaluations against observations at 63 locations in complex terrain include four high-impact windstorms (occurring in 1919, 1935, 1990, and 1999) and 14 recent windstorms (occurring between 1993 and 2011). Peak sustained wind speeds and directions are generally well simulated, although wind speeds are mostly overestimated. In general, performance and skill measures are best for locations on the Swiss Plateau and inferior for Alpine mountain and valley locations. An independent ERA-Interim WRF downscaling configuration produces overall comparable results, implying that the 20CR ensemble mean is a reliable data set in dynamical downscaling exercises. The four evaluated WGPs largely reproduce the observed gustiness, although the timing and magnitude of the peak gusts are not regularly captured. None of the WGPs stands out as single best for the complex topography of Switzerland. Differences among the WGPs are small compared to the biases inherited from the sustained-wind part in the WGP formulations. All WGPs transform overestimated peak sustained winds into underestimated peak gusts, which points to an underrepresentation of the turbulent part in the WGP formulations. The range of simulated peak gusts from downscaling all 20CR ensemble members does not reliably include the observed peak gust, indicating limited benefit in applying an ensemble approach. Despite the limitations, we infer that with spatial optimisations of the simulation (e.g. by bias correction or adaptation of the WGP schemes), downscaling of 20CR input is an efficient option for high-resolution assessments of windstorm hazard and risk in Switzerland.";2016;"windstorm, downscaling, performance, bias, risk"

However, the availability of long-term lake freeze-thaw-cycles, required to understand this proxy for climate variability and change, is scarce for European lakes. Long time series from space observations are limited to few satellite sensors. Data of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are used in account of their unique potential as they offer each day global coverage from the early 1980s expectedly until 2022. An automatic two-step extraction was developed, which makes use of near-infrared reflectance values and thermal infrared derived lake surface water temperatures to extract lake ice phenology dates. In contrast to other studies utilizing thermal infrared, the thresholds are derived from the data itself, making it unnecessary to define arbitrary or lake specific thresholds. Two lakes in the Baltic region and a steppe lake on the Austrian?Hungarian border were selected. The later one was used to test the applicability of the approach to another climatic region for the time period 1990 to 2012. A comparison of the extracted event dates with in situ data provided good agreements of about 10 d mean absolute error. The two-step extraction was found to be applicable for European lakes in different climate regions and could fill existing data gaps in future applications. The extension of the time series to the full AVHRR record length (early 1980 until today) with adequate length for trend estimations would be of interest to assess climate variability and change. Furthermore, the two-step extraction itself is not sensor-specific and could be applied to other sensors with equivalent near- and thermal infrared spectral bands.";2016;"lake, ice, phenology, satellite, climate"

"2120";"Gendered responses to the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria, Australia";"Joshua Whittaker and Christine Eriksen and Katharine Haynes";"This paper presents findings from a gendered analysis of resident responses to the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires (wildfires) in Victoria, Australia. One hundred and seventy-three people lost their lives in the bushfires and more than 2000 houses were destroyed. Previous research on Black Saturday has largely focused on issues of resident preparedness and response, with limited consideration of the role of gender in household decisions and actions. This paper examines the gendered dimensions of risk awareness, preparedness and response among households affected by the bushfires. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with over 600 survivors and a questionnaire of 1314 households in fire-affected areas. Analysis revealed that women more often wanted to leave than men, who more often wanted to stay and defend property against the bushfires. Nevertheless, findings suggest that broad-brush characterisations of staying to defend as a masculine response and leaving as a feminine response are misguided. Although some women expressed a strong desire to leave, others were resolute on staying to defend. Equally, while some men were determined to stay and defend, others had never considered it an option. Despite this, the research identified numerous instances where disagreement had arisen as a result of differing intentions. Conflict most often stemmed from men's reluctance to leave, and was most apparent where households had not adequately planned or discussed their intended responses. The paper concludes by considering the degree to which the findings are consistent with other research on gender and bushfire, and the implications for bushfire safety policy and practice.";2016;"gender, response, awareness, households, conflict"

Here, we use statistical and narrative analyses of data from an online survey and semi-structured interviews with residents affected by the 2013 ?Red October? bushfires in New South Wales, Australia. The survey results revealed that of the 58 % of respondents who were not at home at the time the threat became apparent, 65 % indicated that they attempted to get home prior to the arrival of the fire front. In doing so, many endangered themselves, their family, friends and emergency services personnel. This paper discusses the shortcomings of bushfire survival plans and official risk communication, which do not cater well for household units that are divided or unattended when a bushfire starts. Findings suggest that to enhance bushfire safety and preparedness, emergency managers should acknowledge and speak more directly to the specific constraints to action for particular social groups at the wildland?urban interface, including families with school-age children, commuters and absentee landholders.";2016;"bushfire, residents, survey, safety, communication"
"2124";"Stressors in the Marine Environment";"S Willcock and Sarwar Sohel and G Poppy";"With increasing populations, global resources and processes must be managed sustainably to ensure the continuation of livelihoods. However, this must be achieved in a fair and just manner, safeguarding people?s most basic needs and satisfying human rights. Both planetary resource boundaries and the inter-related social foundations can involve complex, non-linear relationships and may well include a wide range of tipping points (where a small change in a driving force results in a strongly non-linear response). Using models can help to develop an understanding of complex systems, to demonstrate trade-offs and potential tipping points, and to provide a testing ground for new practices and policies. Nevertheless, they do not remove the risk associated with decision making. Frameworks (such as the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response framework and the United States Environmental Protection Agency ecological risk assessment) can perform three vital roles to help manage complex systems: (i) to guide research direction; (ii) to simplify outputs to the level desired by many policy-makers; and (iii) to evaluate the risks associated with specified actions. The application of the techniques outlined in this chapter help decision makers to act promptly, despite both high complexity and uncertainty, to reduce pressures on environmental systems and avoid catastrophic changes of state.";2016;"populations, resources, sustainable, models, frameworks"

"2134";"Perception, Interpretation and Managing of Climate Change and Related Natural Hazards in Tajikistan";"B{'e";"Risks from climate change and natural hazards are heavily menacing the people of Tajik communities in almost every corner of the country. The view on and the perception of these risks and the interpretation of subsequent disasters is strongly influenced by the Muslim culture on the one side and by the difficult economic conditions of individuals, households, communities and the society as a whole on the other side. This research aims to contribute to the understanding of Central Asian people's perception and interpretation of nature and their views and approaches to today's environmental changes and risks.  Tajikistan is highly disaster-prone; climate-induced hazards like floods, droughts, mud flows, cold waves or snow avalanches constitute a major threat to people?s live, livelihood and (sustainable) development. Whereas scientific technical knowledge about climate change and resulting natural hazards and environmental degradation exists to a certain extent, the knowledge about local people?s perceptions and interpretation of nature and its hazardous development is scarce. This gap has been addressed by fieldwork using ethnographic methods in selected villages in Southern Khatlon and Kuhistoni Badakhshon. A total of 230 interviews and focus group discussions were conducted between 2010 and 2013 in these two geographically and culturally different areas. The interpretation of the results explains differences of the scientific technical and local citizens' views and highlights to what extent the perception and resulting actions are influenced by factors like educational background, religious affiliation and depth of religiosity or gender. A review of today?s literature of the Muslim academic community about the topic was carried out in addition to the fieldwork.  The studies in Southern Khatlon and Kuhistoni Badakshon revealed a clear distinction between a rational, technical view and a cultural and religious interpretation of nature, climate change and related natural hazards and subsequent disasters. Whereas villagers have a bias towards the spiritual side, clerical people or schoolchildren are also using scientific-technical explanations for the occurrence of risks and disasters. This coincides with the views of the Islamic science community: Muslim scientists use in parallel a scientific-technical framework as well as a strong spiritual one. In contrary, the cultural and religious realm in the discussion of the topic is completely missing in the official Tajikistan (national and local authorities) as well as in Tajik media. Here the scientific-technical (and Western) view prevails.   The studies further revealed that risks from climate change, related natural hazards and environmental degradation are only one type of risks in a context of high economic threats and political uncertainty: health risks, economic shortfalls (including aspects of poverty and food insecurity), political stability or educational deficiencies are much higher on peoples' agenda than the environment. Almost everybody acknowledges environmental problems but considers these of lower importance than the other risks. However, households and communities in the Pamir value their environment much less a threat than those in Southern Khatlon, although disasters from natural hazards seem to be much more obvious in the Pamir. Many individuals show fatalistic attitudes towards hazards, risks and and subsequent disasters; nevertheless, there are also practical as well as spiritual risk management strategies people apply. Obviously, the higher the level of poverty the less people see the necessity to be concerned about the environment. They would opt for risk reduction and environmental protection only when they have a direct (economic) benefit from these activities.";2016;"tajik, perception, hazards, climate change, environment"

The objective of the M-AARE project is to test the potentials and opportunities of a model chain that relates atmospheric conditions to flood losses or risks. The M-AARE model chain is a set of coupled models consisting of four main components: the precipitation module, the hydrology module, the hydrodynamic module, and the damage module. The models are coupled in a cascading framework with harmonized time-steps. First exploratory applications show that the one way coupling of the WRF-PREVAH-BASEMENT  models has been achieved and provides promising new insights for a better understanding of key aspects in flood risk analysis.";2016;"flood, models, weather, losses, coupling"

Reducing shifting cultivation is a high priority for policy-makers and conservationists; however, spatially explicit evidence of shifting cultivation is lacking due to the difficulty of mapping it with common remote sensing methods. To overcome this challenge, we adopted a landscape mosaic approach to assess the changes between natural forests, shifting cultivation and permanent cultivation systems at the regional level from 1995 to 2011. Our study confirmed that shifting cultivation is still being used to produce subsistence rice throughout the region, but there is a trend of intensification away from shifting cultivation towards permanent rice production, especially near protected areas. While large continuous forest exists today only in the core zones of protected areas, the agricultural matrix is still dominated by a dense cover of tree crops and smaller forest fragments. We believe that this evidence makes a crucial contribution to the development of interventions to prevent further conversion of forest to agricultural land while improving local land users' well-being.";2016;"biodiversity, deforestation, shifting, cultivation, forest"

Because humans have affected Mediterranean ecosystems for millennia, it is unclear whether the region's native ecosystems were more resilient to climate change than current ecosystems, and whether they would provide sustainable management options if restored. We simulated vegetation with the LandClim model, using present-day climate as well as future climate-change scenarios, in three representative areas that encompass a broad range of Mediterranean conditions and vegetation types. Sedimentary pollen records that document now-extinct forests help to validate the simulations. Forests modeled under present climate closely resemble the extinct forests when human disturbance is limited; under future scenarios, characterized by increased temperatures and decreased precipitation, extinct forests are projected to re-emerge. When combined with modeling, paleoecological evidence reveals the potential of native vegetation to re-establish under current and future climate conditions, and provides a template for novel management strategies to maintain forest productivity and biodiversity in a warmer and drier future.";2015;"mediterranean, climate change, vegetation, ecosystems, management"

However, whether biodiversity loss is amajor component of global change effects on multifunctionality in real-world ecosystems, as inexperimental ones, remains unclear. Therefore, we assessed biodiversity, functional compositionand 14 ecosystem services on 150 agricultural grasslands differing in land-use intensity. We alsointroduce ?ve multifunctionality measures in which ecosystem services were weighted according torealistic land-use objectives. We found that indirect land-use effects, i.e. those mediated by biodi-versity loss and by changes to functional composition, were as strong as direct effects on average.Their strength varied with land-use objectives and regional context. Biodiversity loss explainedindirect effects in a region of intermediate productivity and was most damaging when land-useobjectives favoured supporting and cultural services. In contrast, functional composition shifts,towards fast-growing plant species, strongly increased provisioning services in more inherentlyunproductive grasslands.";2015;"global, change, biodiversity, ecosystem services, land-use."

Informing such initiatives requires knowledge about the nexus between land use, poverty, and environment. This paper presents results from Lao PDR, where we combined nationwide spatial data on land use types and the environmental state of landscapes with village-level poverty indicators. Our analysis reveals two general but contrasting trends. First, landscapes with paddy or permanent agriculture allow a greater number of people to live in less poverty but come at the price of a decrease in natural vegetation cover. Second, people practising extensive swidden agriculture and living in intact environments are often better off than people in degraded paddy or permanent agriculture. As poverty rates within different landscape types vary more than between landscape types, we cannot stipulate a land use?poverty?environment nexus. However, the distinct spatial patterns or configurations of these rates point to other important factors at play. Drawing on ethnicity as a proximate factor for endogenous development potentials and accessibility as a proximate factor for external influences, we further explore these linkages. Ethnicity is strongly related to poverty in all land use types almost independently of accessibility, implying that social distance outweighs geographic or physical distance. In turn, accessibility, almost a precondition for poverty alleviation, is mainly beneficial to ethnic majority groups and people living in paddy or permanent agriculture. These groups are able to translate improved accessibility into poverty alleviation. Our results show that the concurrence of external influences with local{--";2015;"land, poverty, environment, ethnicity, accessibility"

In this paper we use the relationship between chrysophyte assemblages and the number of days below 4 ?C (DB4 ?C) in the epilimnion of a lake in northern Poland to develop a transfer function and to reconstruct winter severity in Poland for the last millennium. DB4 ?C is a climate variable related to the length of the winter. Multivariate ordination techniques were used to study the distribution of chrysophytes from sediment traps of 37 low-land lakes distributed along a variety of environmental and climatic gradients in northern Poland. Of all the environmental variables measured, stepwise variable selection and individual Redundancy analyses (RDA) identified DB4 ?C as the most important variable for chrysophytes, explaining a portion of variance independent of variables related to water chemistry (conductivity, chlorides, K, sulfates), which were also important. A quantitative transfer function was created to estimate DB4 ?C from sedimentary assemblages using partial least square regression (PLS).

In doing so, we reject a ?top-down? perspective and examine how these institutional transitions are shaped through processes of ?domestication?, negotiation and contestation between different interest groups in the city. We develop our argument, by drawing attention to the local political debates surrounding the propiska in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. The propiska developed throughout the Soviet Union to control internal migration and is still used today in a less restrictive form.

Fossil coccolithophore assemblages have been studied along with the U37k?-estimated sea-surface temperature (SST) and other paleoenvironmental proxies. The appearance of this cell is suggested at 7.7 ka cal. BP and was linked to the establishment of the western anti-cyclonic gyre. From that time until the present, the nannofossil accumulation rate of Florisphaera profunda has revealed successive episodes of weakening and strengthening of upwelling conditions in the Alboran Sea that have been simultaneous to changes in Western Mediterranean Deep Water (WMDW) formation in the Gulf of Lions. A two-phase scenario operating at millennial?centennial time scale is proposed to explain this climatic and oceanographic variability: (1) coeval with more arid climate conditions, weaker northerlies  or  north-westerlies  blowing  over  the  Gulf  of  Lions  would  have  triggered  a  slackening  of  WMDW  formation.  This  together  with  a  minor  Atlantic Jet (AJ) inflowing into the Alboran Sea would have led to less vertical mixing and, hence, a more stable water column in the study area; (2) wetter climate conditions would have prevailed in the region, while stronger northerlies or north-westerlies would have enabled WMDW reinforcement in the Gulf of Lions simultaneous to an intensification of the AJ that migrated southward. This would have increased vertical mixing, intensifying upwelling conditions in the study area.

We used the Global Forest Cover Change (2000?2012) and the most recent Lao Agricultural Census (2011) datasets to assess forest cover change in resettled and non-resettled villages throughout the country. We also reviewed a set of six case studies and performed an original case study in two villages of Luang Prabang province with 55 households, inquiring about relocation, land losses and intensification options. Our results show that resettled villages have greater baseline forest cover and total forest loss than most villages in Laos but not significant forest loss relative to that baseline. Resettled villages are consistently associated with forested areas, minority groups, and intermediate accessibility. The case studies highlight that resettlement coupled with land use planning does not necessarily lead to the abandonment of shifting cultivation or affect forest loss but lead to a re-spatialization of land use. This includes clustering of forest clearings, which might lead to fallow shortening and land degradation while limited intensification options exist in the resettled villages. This study provides a contribution to studying relationships between migration, forest cover change, livelihood strategies, land governance and agricultural practices in tropical forest environments.";2015;"forest, resettlement, laos, land, migration"

Although the need for regional spatially-explicit comprehensive reconstructions is widely recognized, the proxy data sources are still scarce, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere and especially for South America.  We present a 600-year long warm season temperature record from varved sediments of Lago Plomo, a proglacial lake of the Northern Patagonian Ice field in Southern Chile (46?59?S, 72?52?W, 203 m a.s.l.). The thickness of the bright summer sediment layer relative to the dark winter layer (measured as total brightness; % reflectance 400?730 nm) is calibrated against warm season SONDJF temperature (1900?2009; r = 0.58, p(aut) = 0.056, RE = 0.52; CE = 0.15, RMSEP = 0.28 ?C; five-year triangular filtered data). In Lago Plomo, warm summer temperatures lead to enhanced glacier melt and suspended sediment transport, which results in thicker light summer layers and to brighter sediments. Although Patagonia shows pronounced regional differences in decadal temperature trends and variability, the 600 years temperature reconstruction from Lago Plomo compares favourably with other regional/continental temperature records, but also emphasizes significant regional differences for which no data and information existed so far. These regional differences seem to be real as they are also reflected in modern climate data sets (1900?2010). The reconstruction shows pronounced subdecadal ? multidecadal variability with cold phases during parts of the Little Ice Age (16th and 18th centuries) and in the beginning of the 20th century. The most prominent warm phase is the 19th century which is as warm as the second half of the 20th century. The exceptional summer warmth AD 1780?1810 is also found in other archives of Northern Patagonia and Central Chile. Our record shows the delayed 20th century warming in the Southern Hemisphere.  The comparison between winter precipitation and summer temperature (inter-seasonal coupling) from Lago Plomo reveals alternating phases with parallel and contrasting decadal trends of winter precipitation and summer temperature (positive and negative running correlations Rwinter PP; summer TT). This observation from the sediment proxy data is also confirmed by two sets of reanalysis data for the 20th century. Reanalysis data show that phases with negative correlations between winter precipitation and summer temperature (e.g., dry winters and warm summers) at Lago Plomo are characteristic for periods when circumpolar Westerly flow is displaced southward and enhanced around 60?S.";2015;"proxy, temperature, patagonia, southern, chile"

In this study, catchment-averaged daily precipitation time series are analyzed prior to annual peak discharge events (floods) in Switzerland. The high number of floods considered ? more than 4000 events from 101 catchments have been analyzed ? allows to derive significant information about the role of antecedent precipitation for peak discharge generation. Based on the analysis of precipitation times series, a new separation of flood-related precipitation periods is proposed: (i) the period 0 to 1 day before flood days, when the maximum flood-triggering precipitation rates are generally observed, (ii) the period 2 to 3 days before flood days, when longer-lasting synoptic situations generate \"significantly higher than normal\" precipitation amounts, and (iii) the period from 4 days to 1 month before flood days when previous wet episodes may have already preconditioned the catchment. The novelty of this study lies in the separation of antecedent precipitation into the precursor antecedent precipitation (4 days before floods or earlier, called PRE-AP) and the short range precipitation (0 to 3 days before floods, a period when precipitation is often driven by one persistent weather situation like e.g., a stationary low-pressure system). A precise separation of \"antecedent\" and \"peak-triggering\" precipitation is not attempted. Instead, the strict definition of antecedent precipitation periods permits a direct comparison of all catchments.  The precipitation accumulating 0 to 3 days before an event is the most relevant for floods in Switzerland. PRE-AP precipitation has only a weak and region-specific influence on flood probability. Floods were significantly more frequent after wet PRE-AP periods only in the Jura Mountains, in the western and eastern Swiss plateau, and at the outlet of large lakes. As a general rule, wet PRE-AP periods enhance the flood probability in catchments with gentle topography, high infiltration rates, and large storage capacity (karstic cavities, deep soils, large reservoirs). In contrast, floods were significantly less frequent after wet PRE-AP periods in glacial catchments because of reduced melt.  For the majority of catchments however, no significant correlation between precipitation amounts and flood occurrences is found when the last 3 days before floods are omitted in the precipitation amounts. Moreover, the PRE-AP was not higher for extreme floods than for annual floods with a high frequency and was very close to climatology for all floods. The fact that floods are not significantly more frequent nor more intense after wet PRE-AP is a clear indicator of a short discharge memory of Pre-Alpine, Alpine and South Alpine Swiss catchments. Our study poses the question whether the impact of long-term precursory precipitation for floods in such catchments is not overestimated in the general perception. The results suggest that the consideration of a 3?4 days precipitation period should be sufficient to represent (understand, reconstruct, model, project) Swiss Alpine floods.";2015;"precipitation, floods, antecedent, discharge, catchments"

Insights are provided into vegetation preferences in areas where properties neighbor large areas of native vegetation, such as national parks, or exist within a matrix of cleared and vegetated private and public land. In such areas, managing fuel loads in the proximity of houses is likely to reduce the risk of house loss and damage. Preferences for vegetation appearance and structure were related to varying fuel loads, particularly the density of understorey vegetation and larger trees. The study adopted a qualitative visual research approach, which used ranking and photo-elicitation as part of a broader interview. A visual approach aids in focusing on outcomes of fuel management interventions, for example, by using the same photo scenes to firstly derive residents? perceptions of amenity and secondly, residents? perceptions of bushfire risk. The results are consistent with existing research on landscape preferences; residents tend to prefer relatively open woodland or forest landscapes with good visual and physical access but with elements that provoke their interest. Overall, residents? landscape preferences were found to be consistent with vegetation management that reduces bushfire risk to houses. The terms in which preferences were expressed provide scope for agency engagement with residents in order to facilitate management that meets amenity and hazard reduction goals on private land.";2015;"landscape, preferences, residents, vegetation, management"

And what about other factors: Are they specifically relevant for creative individuals or simply valid for the whole population? This study contributes to the discussion on the highly skilled by investigating whether tolerance, taxes, or other regional amenities contribute to their concentration and dynamics. The results show that tolerance in particular toward immigrants, but also toward same-sex partnerships, is a rather dynamic concept, differs largely between and within functional urban regions, and makes a difference regarding the highly skilled.";2015;"human, growth, factors, tolerance, region"

Glaciers were associated with the Late Pleistocene cold stages and reached as far down as 3,760 m asl in northern and 3,200 m asl in southern Ethiopia. Bale Mountains had the most extensive Late Pleistocene glaciation, covering over 190 km2, followed by Arsi Mountains (about 85 km2). In Simen, the Late Pleistocene glaciers covered merely 13 km2. In addition, paleo-periglacial slope deposits are found on all above-mentioned paleoglaciated mountains and in further mountain systems which did not host glaciers. This allows the reconstruction of the Late Pleistocene paleoclimate as being about 8 ?C colder than at present (2014), much more dry, and probably without monsoon, at least in northern Ethiopia. Most probably in the Early Holocene, the re-emergence of monsoonal rains led to a strong erosion phase, which was followed by an extended stable phase with soil formation, building up about 70-cm-deep A-horizons (Andosol) on the paleo-periglacial slope deposits. These soils have been heavily degraded due to human-induced soil erosion up to about 3800 m asl since agriculture started several decades to millennia ago.";2015;"ethiopia, late, pleistocene, glaciers, erosion"

Cocoa is grown in cultivation systems of varying ecological complexity. The plantations are highly susceptible to climate change impacts. Local cocoa producers mention heat waves, droughts, floods and plant diseases as the main impacts affecting plants and working conditions, and they associate these impacts with global climate change. From a sustainable regional development point of view, cocoa farms need to become more resilient in order to cope with the climate change related effects that are putting cocoa-based livelihoods at risk. This study assesses agroecosystem resilience under three different cocoa cultivation systems (successional agroforestry, simple agroforestry and common practice monocultures). In a first step, farmers? perceptions of climate change impacts were assessed and eight indicators of agroecological resilience were derived in a transdisciplinary process (focus groups and workshop) based on farmers? and scientists? knowledge. These indicators (soil organic matter, depth of Ah horizon, soil bulk density, tree species diversity, crop varieties diversity, ant species diversity, cocoa yields and infestation of cocoa trees with Moniliophthora perniciosa) were then surveyed on 15 cocoa farms and compared for the three different cultivation systems. Parts of the socio-economic aspects of resilience were covered by evaluating the role of cocoa cooperatives and organic certification in transitioning to more resilient cocoa farms (interviews with 15 cocoa farmers combined with five expert interviews). Agroecosystem resilience was higher under the two agroforestry systems than under common practice monoculture, especially under successional agroforestry. Both agroforestry systems achieved higher cocoa yields than common practice monoculture due to agroforestry farmers? enhanced knowledge regarding cocoa cultivation. Knowledge sharing was promoted by local organizations facilitating organic certification. These organizations were thus found to enhance the social process of farmers? integration into cooperatives and their reorientation toward organic principles and diversified agroforestry.";2015;"cocoa, agroecosystem, resilience, climate change, agroforestry"

Therefore, the chapter links spatial patterns of land acquisitions to underlying implementation processes of land allocation. Methodologically linking the described patterns and processes proved difficult, but we have identified indicators that could be added to inventories and monitoring systems to make linkage possible. Combining complementary approaches in this way may help to determine where policy space exists for more sustainable governance of land acquisitions, both geographically and with regard to processes of agrarian transitions. Our spatial analysis revealed two general patterns: (i) relatively large forestry-related acquisitions that target forested landscapes and often interfere with semi-subsistence farming systems; and (ii) smaller agriculture-related acquisitions that often target existing cropland and also interfere with semi-subsistence systems. Furthermore, our meta-analysis of land acquisition implementation processes shows that authoritarian, top-down processes dominate. Initially, the demands of powerful regional and domestic investors tend to override socio-ecological variables, local actors? interests, and land governance mechanisms. As available land grows scarce, however, and local actors gain experience dealing with land acquisitions, it appears that land investments begin to fail or give way to more inclusive, bottom-up investment models.";2015;"qualitative, quantitative, patterns, spatial, processes"

The canton of Vaud in Western Switzerland is an example of such a region as it has experienced water shortage episodes during the past decade. Based on an integrated modeling framework, this study explores how hydro-climatic conditions and water needs could evolve in mountain environments and assesses their potential impacts on water stress by the 2060 horizon. Flows were simulated based on a daily semi-distributed hydrological model. Future changes were derived from Swiss climate scenarios based on two regional climate models. Regarding water needs, the authorities of the canton of Vaud provided a population growth scenario while irrigation and livestock trends followed a business-as-usual scenario. Currently, the canton of Vaud experiences moderate water stress from June to August, except in its Alpine area where no stress is noted. In the 2060 horizon, water needs could exceed 80% of the rivers' available resources in low- to mid-altitude environments in mid-summer. This arises from the combination of drier and warmer climate that leads to longer and more severe low flows, and increasing urban (+ 40%) and irrigation (+ 25%) water needs. Highlighting regional differences supports the development of sustainable development pathways to reduce water tensions. Based on a quantitative assessment, this study also calls for broader impact studies including water quality issues.";2015;"hydro-climatic, water needs, modeling, future changes, water stress"

Grams";"Alpine heavy precipitation events often affect small catchments, although the circulation pattern leading to the event extends over the entire North Atlantic. The various scale interactions involved are particularly challenging for the numerical weather prediction of such events. Unlike previous studies focusing on the southern Alps, here a comprehensive study of a heavy precipitation event in the northern Alps in October 2011 is presented with particular focus on the role of the large-scale circulation in the North Atlantic/European region. During the event exceptionally high amounts of total precipitable water occurred in and north of the Alps. This moisture was initially transported along the flanks of a blocking ridge over the North Atlantic. Subsequently, strong and persistent northerly flow established at the upstream flank of a trough over Europe and steered the moisture towards the northern Alps. Lagrangian diagnostics reveal that a large fraction of the moisture emerged from the West African coast where a subtropical upper-level cut-off low served as an important moisture collector. Wave activity flux diagnostics show that the ridge was initiated as part of a low-frequency, large-scale Rossby wave train while convergence of fast transients helped to amplify it locally in the North Atlantic. A novel diagnostic for advective potential vorticity tendencies sheds more light on this amplification and further emphasizes the role of the ridge in amplifying the trough over Europe. Operational forecasts misrepresented the amplitude and orientation of this trough.  For the first time, this study documents an important pathway for northern Alpine flooding, in which the interaction of synoptic-scale to large-scale weather systems and of long-range moisture transport from the Tropics are dominant. Moreover, the trapping of moisture in a subtropical cut-off near the West African coast is found to be a crucial precursor to the observed European high-impact weather.";2015;"alpine, heavy, precipitation, circulation, moisture"

Roesti and S. Denier and Umberto Lombardo and Heinz Veit";"In the Bolivian Amazon several paleochannel generations are preserved. Their wide spectrum of morphologies clearly provides crucial information on the type and magnitude of geomorphic and hydrological changes within the drainage network of the Andean foreland. Therefore, in this study we mapped geomorphological characteristics of paleochannels, and applied radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating. Seven paleochannel generations are identified. Significant changes in sinuosity, channel widths and river pattern are observed for the successive paleochannel generations. Our results clearly reflect at least three different geomorphic and hydrological periods in the evolution of the fluvial system since the late Pleistocene. Changes in discharge and sediment load may be controlled by combinations of two interrelated mechanisms: (i) spatial changes and re-organizations of the drainage network in the upper catchment, and/or (ii) climate changes with their associated local to catchment-scale modifications in vegetation cover, and changes in discharge, inundation frequencies and magnitudes, which have likely affected the evolution of the fluvial system in the Llanos de Moxos. In summary, our study has revealed the enormous potential which geomorphic mapping and analysis combined with luminescence based chronologies hold for the reconstruction of the late Pleistocene to recent fluvial system in a large portion of Amazonia.";2015;"amazonia, paleochannels, geomorphological, luminescence, chronologies"

There is much scientific interest in the connection between the emergence of gender-based inequalities and key biographical transition points of couples in long-term relationships. Little empirical research is available comparing the evolution of a couple?s respective professional careers over space and time. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to filling this gap by addressing the following questions: what are the critical biographical moments when gender (in)equalities within a relationship begin to arise and consolidate? Which biographical decisions precede and follow such critical moments? How does decision making at critical moments impact the opportunities of both relationship partners in gaining equal access to paid employment?  Design/methodology/approach ? These questions are addressed from the perspectives of intersectionality and economic citizenship. Biographical interviewing is used to collect the personal and professional narratives of Swiss-, bi-national and migrant couples. The case study of a Swiss-Norwegian couple illustrates typical processes by which many skilled migrant women end up absently or precariously employed.  Findings ? Analysis reveals that the Scandinavian woman?s migration to Switzerland is a primary and critical moment for emerging inequality, which is then reinforced by relocation (to a small town characterized by conservative gender values) and the subsequent births of their children. It is concluded that factors of traditional gender roles, ethnicity and age intersect to create a hierarchical situation which affords the male Swiss partner more weight in terms of decision making and career advancement.  Practical implications ? The paper?s findings are highly relevant to the formulation of policies regarding gender inequalities and the implementation of preventive programmes within this context.  Originality/value ? Little empirical research is available comparing the evolution of a couple?s respective professional careers over space and time. The originality of this paper is to fill this research gap; to include migration as a critical moment for gender inequalities; to use an intersectional and geographical perspective that have been given scant attention in the literature; to use the original concept of economic citizenship; and to examine the case of a bi-national couple, which has so far not been examined by the literature on couple relationships.";2015;"gender, intersectionality, migration, inequality, decision-making"

Consequently, the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) lists LWT as an essential climate variable. Although for some European lakes long in situ time series of LWT do exist, many lakes are not observed or only on a non-regular basis making these observations insufficient for climate monitoring. Satellite data can provide the information needed. However, only few satellite sensors offer the possibility to analyse time series which cover 25 years or more. The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) is among these and has been flown as a heritage instrument for almost 35 years. It will be carried on for at least ten more years, offering a unique opportunity for satellite-based climate studies. Herein we present a satellite-based lake surface water temperature (LSWT) data set for European water bodies in or near the Alps based on the extensive AVHRR 1 km data record (1989?2013) of the Remote Sensing Research Group at the University of Bern. It has been compiled out of AVHRR/2 (NOAA-07, -09, -11, -14) and AVHRR/3 (NOAA-16, -17, -18, -19 and MetOp-A) data. The high accuracy needed for climate related studies requires careful pre-processing and consideration of the atmospheric state. The LSWT retrieval is based on a simulation-based scheme making use of the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) Version 10 together with ERA-interim reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts. The resulting LSWTs were extensively compared with in situ measurements from lakes with various sizes between 14 and 580 km2 and the resulting biases and RMSEs were found to be within the range of ?0.5 to 0.6 K and 1.0 to 1.6 K, respectively. The upper limits of the reported errors could be rather attributed to uncertainties in the data comparison between in situ and satellite observations than inaccuracies of the satellite retrieval. An inter-comparison with the standard Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature product exhibits RMSEs and biases in the range of 0.6 to 0.9 and ?0.5 to 0.2 K, respectively.

Thus, combining phylogenetic and trait-based information can be a powerful approach for understanding community assembly processes across a range of spatial scales. We used this approach to investigate tree community composition at Phou Khao Khouay National Park (18?14?-18?32?N; 102?38?- 102?59?E), Laos, where several distinct forest types occur in close proximity. The aim of our study was to examine patterns of plant community assembly across the strong environmental gradients evident at our site. We hypothesized that differences in tree community composition were being driven by an underlying gradient in soil conditions. Thus, we predicted that environmental filtering would predominate at the site and that the filtering would be strongest on sandier soil with low pH, as these are the conditions least favorable to plant growth. We surveyed eleven 0.25 ha (50x50 m) plots for all trees above 10 cm dbh (1221 individual trees, including 47 families, 70 genera and 123 species) and sampled soils in each plot. For each species in the community, we measured 11 commonly studied plant functional traits covering both the leaf and wood economic spectrum traits and we reconstructed a phylogenetic tree for 115 of the species in the community using rbcL and matK sequences downloaded from Genebank (other species were not available). Finally we compared the distribution of trait values and species at two scales (among plots and 10x10m subplots) to examine trait and phylogenetic community structures. Although there was strong evidence that an underlying soil gradient was determining patterns of species composition at the site, our results did not support the hypothesis that the environmental filtering dominated community assembly processes. For the measured plant functional traits there was no consistent pattern of trait dispersion across the site, either when traits were considered individually or when combined in a multivariate analysis. However, there was a significant correlation between the degree of phylogenetic dispersion and the first principle component axis (PCA1) for the soil parameters.Moreover, the more phylogenetically clustered plots were on sandier soils with lower pH. Hence, we suggest that the community assembly processes across our sitemay reflect the influence ofmore conserved traits that we did not measure. Nevertheless, our results are equivocal and other interpretations are possible. Our study illustrates some difficulties in combining trait and phylogenetic approaches that may result from the complexities of integrating spatial and evolutionary processes that vary at different scales.";2015;"plant, community, traits, phylogenetic, soil"

The first method is a thermal approach, relying on the gradient of equivalent potential temperature (TH), while the second method is based on temporal changes in the 10 m wind (WND). For a comprehensive objective comparison of the outputs of these methods of frontal identification, both schemes are firstly applied to an idealised strong baroclinic wave simulation in the absence of topography. Then, two case-studies (one in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and one in the Southern Hemisphere (SH)) were conducted to contrast fronts detected by the methods. Finally, we obtain global winter and summer frontal occurrence climatologies (derived from ERA-Interim for 1979?2012) and compare the structure of these. TH is able to identify cold and warm fronts in strong baroclinic cases that are in good agreement with manual analyses. WND is particularly suited for the detection of strongly elongated, meridionally oriented moving fronts, but has very limited ability to identify zonally oriented warm fronts. We note that the areas of the main TH frontal activity are shifted equatorwards compared to the WND patterns and are located upstream of regions of main WND front activity. The number of WND fronts in the NH shows more interseasonal variations than TH fronts, decreasing by more than 50% from winter to summer. In the SH there is a weaker seasonal variation of the number of observed WND fronts, however TH front activity reduces from summer (DJF) to winter (JJA). The main motivation is to give an overview of the performance of these methods, such that researchers can choose the appropriate one for their particular interest.";2015;"comparison, automated, detection, atmospheric, fronts"

Bavay and {'E";"In this study, we assess the climate mitigation potential from afforestation in a mountainous snow-rich region (Switzerland) with strongly varying environmental conditions. Using radiative forcing calculations, we quantify both the carbon sequestration potential and the effect of albedo change at high resolution. We calculate the albedo radiative forcing based on remotely sensed data sets of albedo, global radiation and snow cover. Carbon sequestration is estimated from changes in carbon stocks based on national inventories. We first estimate the spatial pattern of radiative forcing (RF) across Switzerland assuming homogeneous transitions from open land to forest. This highlights where forest expansion still exhibits climatic benefits when including the radiative forcing of albedo change. Second, given that forest expansion is currently the dominant land-use change process in the Swiss Alps, we calculate the radiative forcing that occurred between 1985 and 1997. Our results show that the net RF of forest expansion ranges from ?24 W m?2 at low elevations of the northern Prealps to 2 W m?2 at high elevations of the Central Alps. The albedo RF increases with increasing altitude, which offsets the CO2 RF at high elevations with long snow-covered periods, high global radiation and low carbon sequestration. Albedo RF is particularly relevant during transitions from open land to open forest but not in later stages of forest development. Between 1985 and 1997, when overall forest expansion in Switzerland was approximately 4%, the albedo RF offset the CO2 RF by an average of 40%. We conclude that the albedo RF should be considered at an appropriately high resolution when estimating the climatic effect of forestation in temperate mountainous regions.";2015;"climate, mitigation, potential, afforestation, switzerland"
"2305";"Biotic and abiotic controls of nitrogen and phosphorus cycling in Central European forests";"Martin Schwarz and Wolfgang Wilcke";"The functioning and services of Central European forests are threatened by global change and a loss of biodiversity. Nutrient cycling as a key forest function is affected by biotic drivers (e.g., dominant tree species, understory plants, soil organisms) that interact with abiotic conditions (e.g., climate, soil properties). In contrast to grassland ecosystems, evidence for the relationship of nutrient cycles and biodiversity in forests is scarce because the structural complexity of forests limits experimental control of driving factors. Alternatively, observational studies along gradients in abiotic conditions and biotic properties may elucidate the role of biodiversity for forest nutrient cycles.  This thesis aims to improve the understanding of the functional importance of biodiversity for nutrient cycles in forests by analyzing water-bound fluxes of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) along gradients in biodiversity in three regions of Germany. The tested hypotheses included: (1) temperate forest canopies retain atmospheric N and retention increases with increasing plant diversity, (2) N release from organic layers increases with resource availability and population size of decomposers but N leaching decreases along a gradient in plant diversity, (3) P leaching from forest canopies increases with improved P supply from recalcitrant P fractions by a more diverse ectomycorrhizal fungal community.  In the canopies of 27 forest stands from three regions, 16 % to 51 % of atmospheric N inputs were retained. Regional differences in N retention likely resulted from different in N availability in the soil. Canopy N retention was greater in coniferous than in beech forests, but this was not the case on loessderived soils. Nitrogen retention increased with increasing tree and shrub diversity which suggested complementary aboveground N uptake. The strength of the diversity effect on canopy N uptake differed among regions and between coniferous and deciduous forests. The N processing in the canopy directly coupled back to N leaching from organic layers in beech forests because throughfall-derived N flushed almost completely through the mull-type organic layers at the 12 studied beech sites. The N release from organic layers increased with stand basal area but was rather low ({ensuremath{<";2015;"forests, biodiversity, nutrient cycling, nitrogen, phosphorus"

Desertification poses an additional threat to agricultural production on marginal slopes, which are often stony and degraded. In a participatory process embedded in the EU DESIRE research project, potential sustainable land management measures were selected to address land degradation and desertification. Promising experiences with no-tillage practices elsewhere in Morocco had motivated the Moroccan government to promote conservation agriculture throughout the country. This combination of crop rotation, minimal soil disturbance and soil cover maintenance, however, had not yet been tested on sloping degraded land. Field trials of grazing enclosure combined with no or minimum tillage were conducted on the plots of two farmers, and trial results were analyzed based on stakeholders? criteria.

On the base of previously published datings, our study concentrates on the MIS 3/2 transition. The results of detailed micromorphological investigations prove that palaeopedogenesis, frost processes, and sedimentation rates differ in their spatial occurrence in the loess belt of Austria. All three sequences are in line with the general trend of a reduced intensity of pedogenic and cryogenic features from western to (south-)eastern Europe, which can be explained by lower Atlantic moisture influence towards the east. Interstadial cambic horizons are well developed in the MIS 3 sequence of western Austria, whereas the eastern loess profiles only show weak pedogenesis. In all studied sequences frost processes were active during the upper MIS 3 and MIS 2. The studied MIS 2 records are characterised by tundra soils with reductaquic horizons, which is a clear sign for prolonged phases of permafrost. On the spatial scale, the sedimentation rate increases in the eastern loess regions and particularly the Krems-Wachtberg sequence in the centre of the transect experienced an exceptionally high sedimentation rate and can thus be seen as one of the most important high resolution records for the MIS 3/2 transition in European loess regions.";2015;"austria, loess, palaeoenvironmental, micromorphological, sedimentation"

In Madagascar, forest resources make important contributions to the livelihoods of the rural population living at the edges of these forests. Although people benefit from forest resources, forests are continuously cleared and converted into arable land. Despite long-term efforts on the part of researchers, development cooperation projects and government, Madagascar has not been able to achieve a fundamental decrease in deforestation. The question of why deforestation continues in spite of such efforts remains. To answer this question, we aimed at understanding deforestation and forest fragmentation from the perspective of rural households in the Manompana corridor on the east coast. Applying a sustainable livelihood approach, we explored local social-ecological systems to understand: (i) how livelihood strategies leading to deforestation evolve and (ii) how the decrease of forest impacts on households' strategies. Results highlight the complexity of the environmental, cultural and political context in which households? decision-making takes place. Further, we found crucial impacts of deforestation and forest fragmentation on livelihood systems, but also recognized that people have been able to adapt to the changing landscapes without major impacts on their welfare.";2015;"forests, resources, livelihoods, deforestation, households"

Explanations of these findings are scarce and not settled. Some studies suggest considering phenology as one functional trait within a plant's life history strategy. In this study, we adapt an existing phenological model to derive a generalized sensitivity in space (SpaceSens) model for calculating temperature sensitivity of spring plant phenophases across species and locations. The SpaceSens model have three parameters, including the temperature at the onset date of phenophases (Tp), base temperature threshold (Tb) and the length of period (L) used to calculate the mean temperature when performing regression analysis between phenology and temperature. A case study on first leaf date of 20 plant species from eastern China shows that the change of Tp and Tb among different species accounts for interspecific difference in temperature sensitivity. Moreover, lower Tp at lower latitude is the main reason why spring phenological responsiveness is greater there. These results suggest that spring phenophases of more responsive, early-season plants (especially in low latitude) will probably continue to diverge from the other late-season plants with temperatures warming in the future.";2015;"phenological, temperature, sensitivity, species, latitude"

Narrative analysis of semi-structured interviews with 18 households impacted by the bushfire revealed that drought conditions in the months preceding the bushfire left many households dependent on non-reticulated water supplies vulnerable at the time the fire threat became apparent. Despite considerable preparations for water storage and usage during the fire, ?weak links? in planning (e.g., top-ups, failure of pumps, generators and hoses) meant water was not accessible when needed most. This paper discusses a gap in bushfire safety scholarship on water usage and everyday trade-offs amongst residents in areas independent of reticulated (mains) water supplies. Findings suggest a need for more detailed and consistent information in official bushfire safety advice on storing water prior to a bushfire and effective water distribution systems for household defence and fire fighting.";2015;"water, survival, drought, bushfire, household"

Abstract Book. 4th European Congress for Conservation Biology";"Julie Gwendolin Z{\"a";"The north-eastern escarpment of Madagascar has been deemed a global hotspot of biodiversity due to its high levels of endemic speciesbeing heavily threatened by accelerated deforestation rates and landscape changes. The main concern for conservation of the remaining humid primary forests is the shifting cultivation practices of local smallholder farmers for rice production. According to the mainstream narrative, human population growth leads to a shortening of crop-fallow cycles and thus to the accelerated conversion of forests to agricultural land. However, little is currently known about the dynamic changes between forest and shifting cultivation systems at the regional level. Existing land cover change analyses in this area have so far only focused on binary forest to non-forest changes and have therefore failed to account for the dynamic nature of the change processes between forest and different agriculture land use systems. This can be partly explained by the significant challenge to delineate shifting cultivation systems on land cover maps using traditional remote sensing classification approaches. To address this gap we therefore applied a novel GIS approach, that was originally developed for the assessment of shifting cultivation dynamics in Laos and has so far never been applied elsewhere, to map shifting cultivation of different crop-fallow lengths as well as permanent agriculture land use at the regional level. Change analyses of land use maps between 1995 and 2011 allowed us to comprehend the general trends of land use trajectories and their spatial variation. This more detailed understanding of land use change dynamics is key to plan for successful interventions to slow forest loss while at the same time improving local livelihoods. We further believe that this approach holds great potential for conservation monitoring in this resource-rich but povertyprone conservation hotspot.";2015;"biodiversity, deforestation, shifting cultivation, land use, conservation"
"2331";"First Annual FLARE Network Conference";"Julie Gwendolin Z{\"a";"The north-eastern escarpment of Madagascar contains the island?s last remaining large-scale humid forest massifs surrounded by diverse small-scale agricultural mosaics. There is high deforestation mainly caused by shifting cultivation practiced by local land users to produce upland rice for subsistence. Today, large protected areas restrict land users? access to forests to collect wood and other forest products. Moreover, they are no more able to expand their cultivated land, which leads to shorter shifting cultivation cycles and decreasing plot sizes for irrigated rice and cash crop cultivation. Cash crop production of clove and vanilla is exposed to risks such as extreme inter-annual price fluctuations, pests and cyclones. In the absence of work opportunities, agricultural extension services and micro-finance schemes people are stuck in a poverty trap. New development strategies are needed to mitigate the trade-offs between forest conservation and human well-being. As landscape composition and livelihood strategies vary across the region, these strategies need to be spatially differentiated to avoid implementing generic solutions, which do not fit the local context. However, up to date, little is known about the spatial patterns of shifting cultivation and other land use systems at the regional level. This is mainly due to the high spatial and temporal dynamics inherent to shifting cultivation, which makes it difficult to monitor the dynamics of this land use system with remote sensing methods. Furthermore, knowledge about land users? livelihood strategies and the risks and opportunities they face stems from very few local case studies. To overcome this challenge, firstly, we used remote sensing data and a landscape mosaic approach to delineate the main landscape types at the regional level. Secondly, we developed a land user typology based on socio-ecological data from household surveys in 45 villages spread throughout the region. Combining the land user typology with the landscape mosaic map allowed us to reveal spatial patterns of the interaction between landscapes and people and to better understand the trade-offs between forest conservation and local wellbeing. While shifting cultivation systems are being transformed into more intensive permanent agricultural systems in many countries around the globe, Madagascar seems to be an exception to this trend. Linking land cover information to human-environmental interactions over large areas is crucial to designing policies and to inform decision making for a more sustainable development of this resource-rich but poverty-prone context.";2015;"northeastern, madagascar, forest, shifting, cultivation"

To this effect, two 30 year long simulations, spanning the 1981?2010 period, with and without land-atmosphere coupling, have been performed with CRCM5, driven by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis at the boundaries. In the coupled simulation, the soil moisture interacts freely with the atmosphere at each time step, while in the uncoupled simulation, soil moisture is replaced with its climatological value computed from the coupled simulation, thus suppressing the soil moisture-atmosphere interactions. Analyses of the coupled and uncoupled simulations, for the summer period, show strong soil moisture-temperature coupling over the Great Plains, consistent with previous studies. The maxima of soil moisture-precipitation coupling is more spread out and covers the semiarid regions of the western U.S. and parts of the Great Plains. However, the strength of soil moisture-precipitation coupling is found to be generally weaker than that of soil moisture-temperature coupling. The study clearly indicates that land-atmosphere coupling increases the interannual variability of the seasonal mean daily maximum temperature in the Great Plains. Land-atmosphere coupling is found to significantly modulate selected temperature extremes such as the number of hot days, frequency, and maximum duration of hot spells over the Great Plains. Results also suggest additional hot spots, where soil moisture modulates extreme events. These hot spots are located in the southeast U.S. for the hot days/hot spells and in the semiarid regions of the western U.S. for extreme wet spells. This study thus demonstrates that climatologically wet/dry regions can become hot spots of land-atmosphere coupling when the soil moisture decreases/increases to an intermediate transitional level where evapotranspiration becomes moisture sensitive and large enough to affect the climate.";2014;"land-atmosphere, coupling, extreme, temperature, precipitation"

Moreover, the latitude?height structure and temporal variability of the North Atlantic jet during this winter were more characteristic of the North Pacific. This work examines the possibility of a flow regime change from an eddy-driven to a mixed eddy?thermally driven jet. A monthly jet zonality index is defined, which shows that a persistent merged jet state has occurred in the past, both at the end of the 1960s and during a few sporadic months. The anomalously zonal jet is found to be associated with anomalous tropical Pacific diabatic heating and eddy anomalies similar to those found during a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) state. A Lagrangian back-trajectory diagnosis of eight winters suggests the tropical Pacific is a source of momentum to the Atlantic and African jets and that this source was stronger during the winter of 2010. The results suggest that the combination of weak eddy variance and fluxes in the North Atlantic, along with strong tropical heating, act to push the jet toward a merged eddy?thermally driven state. The authors also find significant SST anomalies in the North Atlantic, which reinforce the anomalous zonal winds, particularly in the eastern Atlantic.";2014;"jet, zonal, winter, eddy, tropical"

The reconstruction shows that the Antarctic Ice sheet did not everywhere reach the continental shelf edge at its maximum, that initial retreat was asynchronous, and that the spatial pattern of deglaciation was highly variable, particularly on the inner shelf. The deglacial reconstruction is consistent with a moderate overall excess ice volume and with a relatively small Antarctic contribution to meltwater pulse 1a. We discuss key areas of uncertainty both around the continent and by time interval, and we highlight potential priorities for future work.

Magnusson and Rolf Weingartner";"While many studies have been conducted in mountainous catchments to examine the impact of climate change on hydrology, the interactions between climate changes and land use components have largely unknown impacts on hydrology in alpine regions. They need to be given special attention in order to devise possible strategies concerning general development in these regions. Thus, the main aim was to examine the impact of land use (i.e. bushland expansion) and climate changes (i.e. increase of temperature) on hydrology by model simulations. For this purpose, the physically based WaSiM-ETH model was applied to the catchment of Ursern Valley in the central Alps (191-km2) over the period of 1983?2005. Modelling results showed that the reduction of the mean monthly discharge during the summer period is due primarily to the retreat of snow discharge in time and secondarily to the reduction in the glacier surface area together with its retreat in time, rather than the increase in the evapotranspiration due to the expansion of the ?green alder? on the expense of grassland. The significant decrease in summer discharge during July, August and September shows a change in the regime from b-glacio-nival to nivo-glacial. These changes are confirmed by the modeling results that attest to a temporal shift in snowmelt and glacier discharge towards earlier in the year: March, April and May for snowmelt and May and June for glacier discharge. It is expected that the yearly total discharge due to the land use changes will be reduced by 0.6% in the near future, whereas, it will be reduced by about 5% if climate change is also taken into account.

"2347";"Inter-hemispheric temperature variability over the past millennium";"Raphael Andreas Neukom and Jo{\"e";"The Earth?s climate system is driven by a complex interplay of internal chaotic dynamics and natural and anthropogenic external forcing. Recent instrumental data have shown a remarkable degree of asynchronicity between Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere temperature fluctuations, thereby questioning the relative importance of internal versus external drivers of past as well as future climate variability1, 2, 3. However, large-scale temperature reconstructions for the past millennium have focused on the Northern Hemisphere4, 5, limiting empirical assessments of inter-hemispheric variability on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. Here, we introduce a new millennial ensemble reconstruction of annually resolved temperature variations for the Southern Hemisphere based on an unprecedented network of terrestrial and oceanic palaeoclimate proxy records. In conjunction with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction ensemble5, this record reveals an extended cold period (1594?1677) in both hemispheres but no globally coherent warm phase during the pre-industrial (1000?1850) era. The current (post-1974) warm phase is the only period of the past millennium where both hemispheres are likely to have experienced contemporaneous warm extremes. Our analysis of inter-hemispheric temperature variability in an ensemble of climate model simulations for the past millennium suggests that models tend to overemphasize Northern Hemisphere?Southern Hemisphere synchronicity by underestimating the role of internal ocean?atmosphere dynamics, particularly in the ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere. Our results imply that climate system predictability on decadal to century timescales may be lower than expected based on assessments of external climate forcing and Northern Hemisphere temperature variations5, 6 alone.";2014;"climate, reconstruction, variability, hemisphere, temperature"

The socio-economic situation can also pose challenges, as dryland regions are often characterized by remoteness, marginality, low-productive farming, weak institutions, and even conflict. With threats from climate change, disputes over water, competing claims on land, and migration increasing worldwide, the demands for sustainable land management (SLM) measures will only increase in the future. Within the EU-funded DESIRE project, researchers and stakeholders jointly identified existing SLM technologies and approaches in 17 dryland study sites located in the Mediterranean and around the world. In order to evaluate and share this valuable SLM experience, local researchers documented the SLM technologies and approaches in collaboration with land users, utilizing the internationally recognized WOCAT questionnaires. This article provides an analysis of 30 technologies and 8 approaches, enabling an initial evaluation of how SLM addresses prevalent dryland threats, such as water scarcity, soil degradation, vegetation degradation and low production, climate change, resource use conflicts, and migration. Among the impacts attributed to the documented technologies, those mentioned most were diversified and enhanced production and better management of water and soil degradation, whether through water harvesting, improving soil moisture, or reducing runoff. Favorable local-scale cost?benefit relationships were mainly found when considered over the long term. Nevertheless, SLM was found to improve people?s livelihoods and prevent further outmigration. More field research is needed to reinforce expert assessments of SLM impacts and provide the necessary evidence-based rationale for investing in SLM.";2014;"land, sustainable, management, technologies, drylands"
"2350";"Volcanic Influence on European Summer Precipitation through Monsoons: Possible Cause for ?Years without Summer?*";"Martin Wegmann and Stefan Br{\"o";"Strong tropical volcanic eruptions have significant effects on global and regional temperatures. Their effects on precipitation, however, are less well understood. Analyzing hydroclimatic anomalies after 14 strong eruptions during the last 400 years in climate reconstructions and model simulations, a reduction of the Asian and African summer monsoons and an increase of south-central European summer precipitation in the year following the eruption was found. The simulations provide evidence for a dynamical link between these phenomena. The weaker monsoon circulations weaken the northern branch of the Hadley circulation, alter the atmospheric circulation over the Atlantic?European sector, and increase precipitation over Europe. This mechanism is able to explain, for instance, the wet summer in parts of Europe during the ?year without a summer? of 1816, which up to now has not been explained. This study underlines the importance of atmospheric teleconnections between the tropics and midlatitudes to better understand the regional climate response to stratospheric volcanic aerosols.";2014;"tropical, eruptions, hydroclimatic, anomalies, precipitation"

While several comprehensive paleotemperature reconstructions have been developed across Europe, only a few quantitative high-resolution studies exist for precipitation. Here we present a calibration and verification study of lithoclastic sediment proxies from proglacial Lake Oeschinen (46?30?N, 7?44?E, 1,580 m a.s.l., north?west Swiss Alps) that are sensitive to rainfall for the period AD 1901?2008. We collected two sediment cores, one in 2007 and another in 2011. The sediments are characterized by two facies: (A) mm-laminated clastic varves and (B) turbidites. The annual character of the laminae couplets was confirmed by radiometric dating (210Pb, 137Cs) and independent flood-layer chronomarkers. Individual varves consist of a dark sand-size spring-summer layer enriched in siliciclastic minerals and a lighter clay-size calcite-rich winter layer. Three subtypes of varves are distinguished: Type I with a 1?1.5 mm fining upward sequence; Type II with a distinct fine-sand base up to 3 mm thick; and Type III containing multiple internal microlaminae caused by individual summer rainstorm deposits. Delta-fan surface samples and sediment trap data fingerprint different sediment source areas and transport processes from the watershed and confirm the instant response of sediment flux to rainfall and erosion. Based on a highly accurate, precise and reproducible chronology, we demonstrate that sediment accumulation (varve thickness) is a quantitative predictor for cumulative boreal alpine spring (May?June) and spring/summer (May?August) rainfall (rMJ = 0.71, rMJJA = 0.60, p {ensuremath{<";2014;"high-resolution, lake sediment, calibration, precipitation, varves"

A growing body of historical phenological information is now available for Europe, North America, and Asia. In East Asia, long-term phenological series are still relatively scarce. This study extracted plant phenological observations from old diaries in the period 1834?1962. A spring phenology index (SPI) for the modern period (1963?2009) was defined as the mean flowering time of three shrubs (first flowering of Amygdalus davidiana and Cercis chinensis, 50% of full flowering of Paeonia suffruticosa) according to the data availability. Applying calibrated transfer functions from the modern period to the historical data, we reconstructed a continuous SPI time series across eastern China from 1834 to 2009. In the recent 30-years, the SPI is 2.1?6.3-days earlier than during any other consecutive 30-year period before 1970. A moving linear trend analysis shows that the advancing trend of SPI over the past three decades reaches upward of 4.1-d/decade, which exceeds all previously observed trends in the past 30-year period. In addition, the SPI series correlates significantly with spring (February to April) temperatures in the study area, with an increase in spring temperature of 1?C inducing an earlier SPI by 3.1-days. These shifts of SPI provide important information regarding regional vegetation-climate relationships, and they are helpful to assess long term of climate change impacts on biophysical systems and biodiversity.";2014;"phenological, records, historical, series, temperature"

"2361";"Seasonality and magnitude of floods in Switzerland under future climate change";"Nina K{\"o";"The flood seasonality of catchments in Switzerland is likely to change under climate change because of anticipated alterations of precipitation as well as snow accumulation and melt. Information on this change is crucial for flood protection policies, for example, or regional flood frequency analysis. We analysed projected changes in mean annual and maximum floods of a 22-year period for 189 catchments in Switzerland and two scenario periods in the 21st century based on an ensemble of climate scenarios. The flood seasonality was analysed with directional statistics that allow assessing both changes in the mean date a flood occurs as well as changes in the strength of the seasonality. We found that the simulated change in flood seasonality is a function of the change in flow regime type. If snow accumulation and melt is important in a catchment during the control period, then the anticipated change in flood seasonality is most pronounced. Decreasing summer precipitation in the scenarios additionally affects the flood seasonality (mean date of flood occurrence) and leads to a decreasing strength of seasonality, that is a higher temporal variability in most cases. The magnitudes of mean annual floods and more clearly of maximum floods (in a 22-year period) are expected to increase in the future because of changes in flood-generating processes and scaled extreme precipitation. Southern alpine catchments show a different signal, though: the simulated mean annual floods decrease in the far future, that is at the end of the 21st century.

These trajectories provide insight into the seasonally and regionally varying angular momentum and potential vorticity characteristics of the air parcels that end up in the subtropical jet. The trajectories reveal preferred pathways of the air parcels that reach the subtropical jet from the tropics and the extratropics and allow estimation of the tropical and extratropical forcing of the subtropical jet.  The back trajectories were calculated 7 days back in time and started every 6 h from December 2005 to November 2010 using the Interim European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) dataset as a basis. The trajectories were started from the 345-K isentrope in areas where the wind speed exceeded a seasonally varying threshold and where the wind shear was confined to upper levels.  During winter, the South American continent, the Indian Ocean, and the Maritime Continent are preferred areas of ascent into the upper troposphere. From these areas, air parcels follow an anticyclonic pathway into the subtropical jet. During summer, the majority of air parcels ascend over the Himalayas and Southeast Asia.  Angular momentum is overall well conserved for trajectories that reach the subtropical jet from the deep tropics. In winter and spring, the hemispheric-mean angular momentum loss amounts to approximately 6%; in summer, it amounts to approximately 18%; and in fall, it amounts to approximately 13%. This seasonal variability is confirmed using an independent potential vorticity?based method to estimate tropical and extratropical forcing of the subtropical jet.";2014;"climatology, trajectories, angular, momentum, variability"

Average regional canopy N retention ranged from 16% to 51%, because of differences in the N status of the ecosystems. Canopy N budgets of coniferous forests differed from deciduous forest which we attribute to differences in biogeochemical N cycling, tree functional traits and canopy surface area. The canopy budgets of N were related to the Shannon index which explained 14% of the variance of the canopy budgets of N, suggesting complementary aboveground N use of trees and diverse understorey vegetation. The relationship between plant diversity and canopy N retention varied among regional site conditions and forest types.

Therefore a high priority has been assigned to quantifying its temporal and spatial variability. Complementary to land-based monitoring networks, optical satellite observations can be used to derive spatially comprehensive information on snow cover extent. For understanding long-term changes in alpine snow cover extent, the data acquired by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors mounted onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and Meteorological Operational satellite (MetOp) platforms offer a unique source of information.  In this paper, we present the first space-borne 1 km snow extent climatology for the Alpine region derived from AVHRR data over the period 1985?2011. The objective of this study is twofold: first, to generate a new set of cloud-free satellite snow products using a specific cloud gap-filling technique and second, to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of snow cover in the European Alps over the last 27 yr from the satellite perspective. For this purpose, snow parameters such as snow onset day, snow cover duration (SCD), melt-out date and the snow cover area percentage (SCA) were employed to analyze spatiotemporal variability of snow cover over the course of three decades. On the regional scale, significant trends were found toward a shorter SCD at lower elevations in the south-east and south-west. However, our results do not show any significant trends in the monthly mean SCA over the last 27 yr. This is in agreement with other research findings and may indicate a deceleration of the decreasing snow trend in the Alpine region. Furthermore, such data may provide spatially and temporally homogeneous snow information for comprehensive use in related research fields (i.e., hydrologic and economic applications) or can serve as a reference for climate models.";2014;"snow cover, alps, satellite, trends, variability"

The authors argue that REDD+ implementation in such areas runs the risk of: 1) reinforcing economic inequalities based on previous and potential land use impacts on ecosystems (baseline), depending on the socio-cultural groups targeted; 2) increasing pressure on land used for food production, possibly reducing food security and redirecting labour towards scarce off-farm income opportunities; 3) increasing dependence on external funding and carbon market fluctuations instead of local production strategies; and 4) further incentivising the privatization and commodification of land to avoid transaction costs associated with collective property rights. The article also advises against taking a strictly economic, market-based approach to carbon sequestration, arguing that such an approach could endanger fragile socio-ecological systems.

Naturally, the potential of fog has proven its significance in cloud forests that are thriving from fog interception. Historically, the remains of artificial structures in different countries prove that fog has been collected as an alternative and/or supplementary water source. In the beginning of the 19th century, fog collection was investigated as a potential natural resource. After the mid-1980s, following success in Chile, fog-water collection commenced in a number of developing countries. Most of these countries are located in arid and semi-arid regions with topographic and climatic conditions that favour fog-water collection. This paper reviews the technology of fog collection with initial background information on natural fog collection and its historical development. It reviews the climatic and topographic features that dictate fog formation (mainly advection and orographic) and the innovative technology to collect it, focusing on the amount collected, the quality of fog water, and the impact of the technology on the livelihoods of beneficiary communities. By and large, the technology described is simple, cost-effective, and energy-free. However, fog-water collection has disadvantages in that it is seasonal, localised, and the technology needs continual maintenance.

We examined the influence of soil properties and land-use intensity (N fertilization, mowing, grazing) on total phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomass, microbial community composition (PLFA profiles) and activities of enzymes involved in the C, N, and P cycle. These relationships were examined in the topsoil of grasslands from three German regions (Schorfheide-Chorin (SCH), Hainich-Dun (HAI), Schwabische Alb (ALB)) with different parent material. Differences in soil properties explained 60% of variation in PLFA data and 81% of variation in enzyme activities across regions and land-use intensities. Degraded peat soils in the lowland areas of the SCH with high organic carbon (OC) concentrations and sand content contained lower PLFA biomass, lower concentrations of bacterial, fungal, and arbuscular mycorrhizal PLFAs, but greater enzyme activities, and specific enzyme activities (per unit microbial biomass) than mineral soils in the upland areas of the HAI and ALB, which are finer textured, drier, and have smaller OC concentrations. After extraction of variation that originated from large-scale differences among regions and differences in land-use intensities between plots, soil properties still explained a significant amount of variation in PLFA data (34%) and enzyme activities (60%). Total PLFA biomass and all enzyme activities were mainly related to OC concentration, while relative abundance of fungi and fungal to bacterial ratio were mainly related to soil moisture. Land-use intensity (LUI) significantly decreased the soil C:N ratio. There was no direct effect of LUI on total PLFA biomass, microbial community composition, N and P cycling enzyme activities independent of study region and soil properties. In contrast, the activities and specific activities of enzymes involved in the C cycle increased significantly with LUI independent of study region and soil properties, which can have impact on soil organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Our findings demonstrate that microbial biomass and community composition as well as enzyme activities are more controlled by soil properties than by grassland management at the regional scale.

Oriented lakes also occur in the Arctic coastal plains of Russia, Alaska and Canada and along the Atlantic Coastal Plain from northeast Florida to southeast New Jersey and along the coast of northeast Brazil. Many different mechanisms have been proposed for their formation. In the LM, Plafker's (1964) tectonic model, in which subsidence results from the propagation of bedrock faults through the foreland sediments, is the most accepted. However, this model has not been verified. Here, we present new results from stratigraphic transects across the borders of three rectangular and oriented lakes in the LM. A paleosol buried under mid-Holocene sediments is used as a stratigraphic marker to assess the vertical displacement of sediments on both sides of the alleged faults. Our results show that there is no vertical displacement and, therefore, that Plafker's model can be ruled out. We suggest that, among all the proposed mechanisms behind lake formation, the combined action of wind and waves is the most likely. The evidence from the LM provides new hints for the formation of oriented lakes worldwide.";2014;"rectangular, oriented, lakes, formation, mechanisms"

Data were collected from 60 randomly selected Agro-pastoralists/Pastoralists and native farmers using a structured questionnaire. Four villages were involved; two in Lindi region (Matandu and Mkwajuni) and the other two in Ruvuma region (Gumbiro and Muhuwesi). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics of SPSS to generate means and frequencies.   The results indicate that a large number of animals moved into the study area following the eviction order of the government in Ihefu wetlands in 2006/2007. Lindi region was earmarked by the government to receive all the evicted pastoralists. However, by 2008 only 30% of the total cattle that were expected to move into the region had been received. Deaths of many animals on transit, selling of the animals to pay for transportation and other costs while on transit and many pastoralists settling in Coastal and Ruvuma regions before reaching their destinations were reported to be the reasons for the discrepancy observed. To mitigate anticipated conflicts between farmers and pastoralists, Participatory Land Use Management (PLUM) plans were developed in all the study villages in order to demarcate village land area into different uses, including grazing, cropping, settlement and forests. Land units for grazing were supposed to be provided with all necessary livestock infrastructures (dips, charcoal dams, livestock markets and stock routes). However, the land use plans were not able to prevent the anticipated conflicts because most of the livestock infrastructures were lacking, the land use boundaries were not clearly demarcated and there was limited enforcement of village by-laws, since most had not been enacted by the respective district councils. Similarly, the areas allocated for grazing were inadequate for the number of livestock available and thus the carrying capacity exceeded. Thus, land resource-based conflicts between farmers and pastoralists were emerging in the study areas for the reason that most of the important components in the PLUM plans were not in place. Nevertheless, the arrival of pastoralists in the study areas had positive effects on food security and growth of social interactions between pastoralists and farmers including marriages between them.

J{\"o";"The African great lakes are of utmost importance for the local economy (fishing), as well as being essential to the survival of the local people. During the past decades, these lakes experienced fast changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, and their future evolution is a major concern. In this study, for the first time a set of one-dimensional lake models are evaluated for Lake Kivu (2.28?S; 28.98?E), East Africa. The unique limnology of this meromictic lake, with the importance of salinity and subsurface springs in a tropical high-altitude climate, presents a worthy challenge to the seven models involved in the Lake Model Intercomparison Project (LakeMIP). Meteorological observations from two automatic weather stations are used to drive the models, whereas a unique dataset, containing over 150 temperature profiles recorded since 2002, is used to assess the model?s performance. Simulations are performed over the freshwater layer only (60 m) and over the average lake depth (240 m), since salinity increases with depth below 60 m in Lake Kivu and some lake models do not account for the influence of salinity upon lake stratification. All models are able to reproduce the mixing seasonality in Lake Kivu, as well as the magnitude and seasonal cycle of the lake enthalpy change. Differences between the models can be ascribed to variations in the treatment of the radiative forcing and the computation of the turbulent heat fluxes. Fluctuations in wind velocity and solar radiation explain inter-annual variability of observed water column temperatures. The good agreement between the deep simulations and the observed meromictic stratification also shows that a subset of models is able to account for the salinity- and geothermal-induced effects upon deep-water stratification. Finally, based on the strengths and weaknesses discerned in this study, an informed choice of a one-dimensional lake model for a given research purpose becomes possible.";2014;"african, great, lakes, ecosystem, models"

The consequences of these changes for local livelihoods are not well known. This study analyzes the impact of shifting cultivation change on the livelihood of rural people in six villages in three districts of northern and central Laos. Focus group discussions and household interview questionnaires were employed for data collection. The study reveals that the shifting cultivation of rice is still important in these communities, but it is being intensified as cash crops are introduced. Changes in shifting cultivation during the past ten years vary greatly between the communities studied. In the northern study sites, it is decreasing in areas with rubber expansion and increasing in areas with maize expansion, while it is stable in the central site, where sugarcane is an important cash crop. The impacts of land use change on livelihoods are also diverse. Cash crop producers hold more agricultural land than non-cash crop producers, and rubber and sugarcane producers have fewer rice shortages than non-producers. In the future, livelihood improvements in the central study site may be replicated in the northern sites, but this depends to a large extent on the economic and agricultural settings into which cash crops and other development opportunities are introduced. Moreover, the expansion of cash crops appears to counteract Lao policies aimed at replacing shifting cultivation areas with forests.";2014;"transformation, livelihoods, shifting cultivation, cash crops, impact"

The objective of the study was to evaluate and recommend effective biophysical soil and water conservation measure(s) in the Debre Mewi watershed, about 30 km south of the Lake Tana. Six conservation measures were evaluated for their effects on runoff, soil loss, and forage yield using runoff plots. There was a significant difference between treatments for both runoff and soil loss. The four-year average annual soil loss in the different plots ranged from 26 to 71 t ha?1, and total runoff ranged from 180 to 302 mm, while annual rainfall varied between 854 mm in 2008 and 1247 mm in 2011. Soil bund combined with elephant grass had the lowest runoff and soil loss as compared to the other treatments, whereas the untreated control plot had the highest for both parameters. As an additional benefit, 2.8 and 0.7 t ha?1 year?1 of dried forage was obtained from elephant and local grasses, respectively. Furthermore, it was found that soil bund combined with Tephrosia increased soil organic matter by 13% compared to the control plot.

Based on our understanding of these uncertainties, we propose a new model-based approach to generating a volcanic forcing for general circulation model (GCM) and chemistry?climate model (CCM) simulations. This new volcanic forcing, covering the 1600?present period, uses an aerosol microphysical model to provide a realistic, physically consistent treatment of the stratospheric sulfate aerosols. Twenty-six eruptions were modeled individually using the latest available ice cores aerosol mass estimates and historical data on the latitude and date of eruptions. The evolution of aerosol spatial and size distribution after the sulfur dioxide discharge are hence characterized for each volcanic eruption. Large variations are seen in hemispheric partitioning and size distributions in relation to location/date of eruptions and injected SO2 masses. Results for recent eruptions show reasonable agreement with observations. By providing these new estimates of spatial distributions of shortwave and long-wave radiative perturbations, this volcanic forcing may help to better constrain the climate model responses to volcanic eruptions in the 1600?present period. The final data set consists of 3-D values (with constant longitude) of spectrally resolved extinction coefficients, single scattering albedos and asymmetry factors calculated for different wavelength bands upon request.

Schleu{ss";"The Tibetan Plateau has a significant role with regard to atmospheric circulation and the monsoon in particular. Changes between a closed plant cover and open bare soil are one of the striking effects of land use degradation observed with unsustainable range management or climate change, but experiments investigating changes of surface properties and processes together with atmospheric feedbacks are rare and have not been undertaken in the world's two largest alpine ecosystems, the alpine steppe and the Kobresia pygmaea pastures of the Tibetan Plateau. We connected measurements of micro-lysimeter, chamber, 13C labelling, and eddy covariance and combined the observations with land surface and atmospheric models, adapted to the highland conditions. This allowed us to analyse how three degradation stages affect the water and carbon cycle of pastures on the landscape scale within the core region of the Kobresia pygmaea ecosystem. The study revealed that increasing degradation of the Kobresia turf affects carbon allocation and strongly reduces the carbon uptake, compromising the function of Kobresia pastures as a carbon sink. Pasture degradation leads to a shift from transpiration to evaporation while a change in the sum of evapotranspiration over a longer period cannot be confirmed. The results show an earlier onset of convection and cloud generation, likely triggered by a shift in evapotranspiration timing when dominated by evaporation. Consequently, precipitation starts earlier and clouds decrease the incoming solar radiation. In summary, the changes in surface properties by pasture degradation found on the highland have a significant influence on larger scales.";2014;"tibetan plateau, land use, degradation, carbon, precipitation"

It impacts on natural systems, ecosystems, and economic sectors such as agriculture, tourism, and energy, and it affects Swiss livelihood in various ways. The observed and projected changes call for a response from the political system, which in Switzerland is characterized by federalism and direct democratic instruments. Swiss climate science embraces natural and social sciences and builds on institutionalized links between researchers, public, and private stakeholders. In this article, we review the physical, institutional, and political aspects of climate change in Switzerland. We show how the current state of Swiss climate science and policy developed over the past 20 years in the context of international developments and national responses. Specific to Switzerland is its topographic setting with mountain regions and lowlands on both sides of the Alpine ridge, which makes climate change clearly apparent and for some aspects (tourist sector, hydropower, and extreme events) highly relevant and better perceivable (e.g., retreating glaciers). Not surprisingly the Alpine region is of central interest in Swiss climate change studies.";2014;"switzerland, climate change, impact, science, policy"

Taking advantage of the previous kriging mean and variance computations helps avoiding a costly matrix inversion when adding one observation to the TeX already available ones. In addition to traditional update formulae taking into account a single new observation, Emery (2009) proposed formulae for the batch-sequential case, i.e. when TeX new observations are simultaneously assimilated. However, the kriging variance and covariance formulae given in Emery (2009) for the batch-sequential case are not correct. In this paper, we fix this issue and establish correct expressions for updated kriging variances and covariances when assimilating observations in parallel.

The results of an online survey, together with two workshops with community engagement staff and volunteers from rural fire services, convey perceived aids and obstacles for engaging women. Efforts at engaging women with bushfire risk management are shown to align squarely with efforts to create a more gender-balanced and gender-sensitive environment for bushfire brigade volunteers. The paper demonstrates how gender roles and gendered norms are reinforced by the patriarchal structures that shape everyday life and the on-the-ground application of official outreach policy and practice. This, in turn, results in heightened dimensions of gendered vulnerability to bushfire. Three key pointers to more successful engagement emerge from the analysis: the benefits of hands-on experience and practice, the strength of networks and the imperative of supportive learning environments.";2014;"gender-sensitive, outreach, awareness, preparedness, engagement"

The underlying mechanisms remain partly unclear. An open question is why wetter soils can result in either an increase or a decrease of precipitation (positive or negative soil moisture?precipitation feedback, respectively). Here an idealized cloud-resolving modeling framework is used to explore the local soil moisture?precipitation feedback. The approach is able to replicate both positive and negative feedback loops, depending on the environmental parameters.  The mechanism relies on horizontal soil moisture variations, which may develop and intensify spontaneously. The positive expression of the feedback is associated with the initiation of convection over dry soil patches, but the convective cells then propagate over wet patches where they strengthen and preferentially precipitate. The negative feedback may occur when the wind profile is too weak to support the propagation of convective features from dry to wet areas. Precipitation is then generally weaker and falls preferentially over dry patches. The results highlight the role of the midtropospheric flow in determining the sign of the feedback. A key element of the positive feedback is the exploitation of both low convective inhibition (CIN) over dry patches (for the initiation of convection) and high CAPE over wet patches (for the generation of precipitation).";2014;"soil, moisture, airmass, convection, feedback"

Therefore, the theoretical approach of Cultural Theory and its concept of clumsy solution are applied to overcome the dilemma of typical dichotomies by adding a third and a fourth (but not a fifth) perspective. In doing so, normative contradictions between different rational approaches can be revealed, explained and approached with the concept of ?clumsy solutions?. This contribution aims at discussing how this theoretical approach helps us explain and frame a coalition between the Territorial Cohesion Policy and spatial policies.

The overarching aim for all sectors of Antarctica was to reconstruct the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ice sheet extent and thickness, and map the subsequent deglaciation in a series of 5000 year time slices. However, our review of the literature found surprisingly few high quality chronological constraints on changing glacier extents on these timescales in the maritime and sub?Antarctic sector. Therefore, in this paper we focus on an assessment of the terrestrial and offshore evidence for the LGM ice extent, establishing minimum ages for the onset of deglaciation, and separating evidence of deglaciation from LGM limits from those associated with later Holocene glacier fluctuations. Evidence included geomorphological descriptions of glacial landscapes, radiocarbon dated basal peat and lake sediment deposits, cosmogenic isotope ages of glacial features and molecular biological data. We propose a classification of the glacial history of the maritime and sub?Antarctic islands based on this assembled evidence. These include: (Type I) islands which accumulated little or no LGM ice; (Type II) islands with a limited LGM ice extent but evidence of extensive earlier continental shelf glaciations; (Type III) seamounts and volcanoes unlikely to have accumulated significant LGM ice cover; (Type IV) islands on shallow shelves with both terrestrial and submarine evidence of LGM (and/or earlier) ice expansion; (Type V) Islands north of the Antarctic Polar Front with terrestrial evidence of LGM ice expansion; and (Type VI) islands with no data. Finally, we review the climatological and geomorphological settings that separate the glaciological history of the islands within this classification scheme.";2014;"maritime, reconstruct, ice, evidence, classification"

The main premise of such reconstructions is the synsedimentary deposition of biomarkers and dust, which has become a debated subject in recent years. This study uses two independent approaches to test the stratigraphic integrity of leaf-wax biomarkers: (i) long-chain n-alkanes and fatty acids are quantified in two sediment-depth profiles in glacial till on the Swiss Plateau, consisting of a Holocene topsoil and the underlying B and C horizons. Since glacial sediments are initially very poor in organic matter, significant amounts of leaf-wax biomarkers in the B and C horizons of those profiles would reflect postsedimentary root-derived or microbial contributions. (ii) Compound-specific radiocarbon measurements are conducted on n-alkanes and n-alkanoic (fatty) acids from several depth intervals in the loess section \"Crvenka\", Serbia, and the results are compared to independent estimates of sediment age.  We find extremely low concentrations of plant-wax n-alkanes and fatty acids in the B and C horizons below the topsoils in the sediment profiles. Moreover, compound-specific radiocarbon analysis yields plant-wax 14C ages that agree well with published luminescence ages and stratigraphy of the Serbian loess deposit. Both approaches confirm that postsedimentary, root-derived or microbial contributions are negligible in the two investigated systems. The good agreement between the ages of odd and even homologues also indicates that reworking and incorporation of fossil leaf waxes is not particularly relevant either.";2014;"paleoenvironmental, molecular, reconstruction, loess, plant-wax"

However, the few studies addressing resilience from a livelihood perspective take different approaches and focus only on some dimensions of livelihoods. This paper presents a framework that can be used for a comprehensive empirical analysis of livelihood resilience. We use a concept of resilience that considers agency as well as structure. A review of both theoretical and empirical literature related to livelihoods and resilience served as the basis to integrate the perspectives. The paper identifies the attributes and indicators of the three dimensions of resilience, namely, buffer capacity, self-organisation and capacity for learning. The framework has not yet been systematically tested; however, potentials and limitations of the components of the framework are explored and discussed by drawing on empirical examples from literature on farming systems. Besides providing a basis for applying the resilience concept in livelihood-oriented research, the framework offers a way to communicate with practitioners on identifying and improving the factors that build resilience. It can thus serve as a tool for monitoring the effectiveness of policies and practices aimed at building livelihood resilience.";2014;"livelihood, resilience, framework, dimensions, indicators"

This information is, however, not easily derived because natural runoff variability interferes with the climate change signal. This study presents a procedure that leads to robust estimates of magnitude and Time Of Emergence (TOE) of climate-induced hydrological change that also account for the natural variability contained in the time series. Firstly, natural variability of 189 mesoscale catchments in Switzerland is sampled for 10 ENSEMBLES scenarios for the control (1984?2005) and two scenario periods (near future: 2025?2046, far future: 2074?2095) applying a bootstrap procedure. Then, the sampling distributions of mean monthly runoff are tested for significant differences with the Wilcoxon-Mann?Whitney test and for effect size with Cliff?s delta d. Finally, the TOE of a climate change induced hydrological change is determined when at least eight out of the ten hydrological projections significantly differ from natural variability. The results show that the TOE occurs in the near future period except for high-elevated catchments in late summer. The significant hydrological projections in the near future correspond, however, to only minor runoff changes. In the far future, hydrological change is statistically significant and runoff changes are substantial. Temperature change is the most important factor determining hydrological change in this mountainous region. Therefore, hydrological change depends strongly on a catchment?s mean elevation. Considering that the hydrological changes are predicted to be robust in the near future highlights the importance of accounting for these changes in water resources planning.";2014;"sustainable, water, management, climate, change"

However, the governing factors between the composition of soil microbial communities and plant diversity are not well understood. We investigated the impact of plant diversity (plant species richness and functional group richness) and plant functional group identity on soil microbial biomass and soil microbial community structure in experimental grassland ecosystems. Total microbial biomass and community structure were determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis. The diversity gradient covered 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 plant species and 1, 2, 3 and 4 plant functional groups (grasses, legumes, small herbs and tall herbs). In May 2007, soil samples were taken from experimental plots and from nearby fields and meadows. Beside soil texture, plant species richness was the main driver of soil microbial biomass. Structural equation modeling revealed that the positive plant diversity effect was mainly mediated by higher leaf area index resulting in higher soil moisture in the top soil layer. The fungal-to-bacterial biomass ratio was positively affected by plant functional group richness and negatively by the presence of legumes. Bacteria were more closely related to abiotic differences caused by plant diversity, while fungi were more affected by plant-derived organic matter inputs. We found diverse plant communities promoted faster transition of soil microbial communities typical for arable land towards grassland communities. Although some mechanisms underlying the plant diversity effect on soil microorganisms could be identified, future studies have to determine plant traits shaping soil microbial community structure. We suspect differences in root traits among different plant communities, such as root turnover rates and chemical composition of root exudates, to structure soil microbial communities.";2014;"plant, diversity, soil, microbial, community"

Our objective was to assess the effects of plant species and functional richness and functional identity on soil water contents and water fluxes in the experimental grassland of the Jena Experiment. The Jena Experiment comprises 86 plots on which plant species richness (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 60) and functional group composition (zero to four functional groups: legumes, grasses, tall herbs, and small herbs) were manipulated in a factorial design. We recorded meteorological data and soil water contents of the 0?0?0?3 and 0?3?0?7-m soil layers and calculated actual evapotranspiration (ETa), downward flux (DF), and capillary rise with a soil water balance model for the period 2003?2007. Missing water contents were estimated with a Bayesian hierarchical model. Species richness decreased water contents in subsoil during wet soil conditions. Presence of tall herbs increased soil water contents in topsoil during dry conditions and decreased soil water contents in subsoil during wet conditions. Presence of grasses generally decreased water contents in topsoil, particularly during dry phases; increased ETa and decreased DF from topsoil; and decreased ETa from subsoil. Presence of legumes, in contrast, decreased ETa and increased DF from topsoil and increased ETa from subsoil. Species richness probably resulted in complementary water use. Specific functional groups likely affected the water balance via specific root traits (e.g. shallow dense roots of grasses and deep taproots of tall herbs) or specific shading intensity caused by functional group effects on vegetation cover.

To assess the effects of plant species diversity on the nitrogen (N) cycle, we developed a model for monthly mean nitrate (NO3-N) concentrations in soil solution in 0-30 cm mineral soil depth using plant species and functional group richness and functional composition as drivers and assessing the effects of conversion of arable land to grassland, spatially heterogeneous soil properties, and climate. We used monthly mean NO3-N concentrations from 62 plots of a grassland plant diversity experiment from 2003 to 2006. Plant species richness (1-60) and functional group composition (1-4 functional groups: legumes, grasses, non-leguminous tall herbs, non-leguminous small herbs) were manipulated in a factorial design. Plant community composition, time since conversion from arable land to grassland, soil texture, and climate data (precipitation, soil moisture, air and soil temperature) were used to develop one general Bayesian multiple regression model for the 62 plots to allow an in-depth evaluation using the experimental design. The model simulated NO3-N concentrations with an overall Bayesian coefficient of determination of 0.48. The temporal course of NO3-N concentrations was simulated differently well for the individual plots with a maximum plot-specific Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 0.57. The model shows that NO3-N concentrations decrease with species richness, but this relation reverses if more than approx. 25 % of legume species are included in the mixture. Presence of legumes increases and presence of grasses decreases NO3-N concentrations compared to mixtures containing only small and tall herbs. Altogether, our model shows that there is a strong influence of plant community composition on NO3-N concentrations.";2014;"species loss, plant diversity, nitrogen cycle, soil solution, ecosystem functions"

These kinds of measures are particularly valuable in the case of lakes, where shape and orientation patterns can help identifying the geomorphological agents behind lake formation and evolution. However, the lack of built-in tools in commercial geographic information system (GIS) software packages designed for this kind of analysis has meant that many researchers often must rely on tools and workarounds that are not always accurate. Here, an easy-to-use method to measure rectangularity R, ellipticity E, and orientation O is developed. In addition, a new rectangularity vs. ellipticity index, REi, is defined. Following a step-by-step process, it is shown how these measures and index can be easily calculated using a combination of GIS built-in functions. The identification of shapes and estimation of orientations performed by this method is applied to the case study of the geometric and oriented lakes of the Llanos de Moxos, in the Bolivian Amazon, where shape and orientation have been the two most important elements studied to infer possible formation mechanisms. It is shown that, thanks to these new indexes, shape and orientation patterns are unveiled, which would have been hard to identify otherwise.";2014;"geospatial, lakes, measures, rectangles, orientation"

Recently, extensive research efforts were undertaken to develop and refine empirical relationships linking the structural vulnerability of buildings to the impact forces of the hazard processes. These empirical vulnerability functions allow estimating the expected direct losses as a result of the hazard scenario based on spatially explicit representation of the process patterns and the elements at risk classified into defined typological categories. However, due to the underlying empiricism of such vulnerability functions, the physics of the damage-generating mechanisms for a well-defined element at risk with its peculiar geometry and structural characteristics remain unveiled, and, as such, the applicability of the empirical approach for planning hazard-proof residential buildings is limited. Therefore, we propose a conceptual assessment scheme to close this gap. This assessment scheme encompasses distinct analytical steps: modelling (a) the process intensity, (b) the impact on the element at risk exposed and (c) the physical response of the building envelope. Furthermore, these results provide the input data for the subsequent damage evaluation and economic damage valuation. This dynamic assessment supports all relevant planning activities with respect to a minimisation of losses, and can be implemented in the operational risk assessment procedure.";2014;"design, vulnerability, empirical, assessment, mitigation"

Anet and Christoph Raible and Stefan Br{\"o";"An important key for the understanding of the dynamic response to large tropical volcanic eruptions is the warming of the tropical lower stratosphere and the concomitant intensification of the polar vortices. Although this mechanism is reproduced by most general circulation models today, most models still fail in producing an appropriate winter warming pattern in the Northern Hemisphere. In this study ensemble sensitivity experiments were carried out with a coupled atmosphere-ocean model to assess the influence of different ozone climatologies on the atmospheric dynamics and in particular on the northern hemispheric winter warming. The ensemble experiments were perturbed by a single Tambora-like eruption. Larger meridional gradients in the lower stratospheric ozone favor the coupling of zonal wind anomalies between the stratosphere and the troposphere after the eruption. The associated sea level pressure, temperature, and precipitation patterns are more pronounced and the northern hemispheric winter warming is highly significant. Conversely, weaker meridional ozone gradients lead to a weaker response of the winter warming and the associated patterns. The differences in the number of stratosphere-troposphere coupling events between the ensembles experiments indicate a nonlinear response behavior of the dynamics with respect to the ozone and the volcanic forcing.";2014;"tropical, stratosphere, circulation, ozone, eruption"

Rozanov and Stefan Br{\"o";"The newly developed atmosphere?ocean-chemistry-climate model SOCOL-MPIOM is presented by demonstrating the influence of the interactive chemistry module on the climate state and the variability. Therefore, we compare pre-industrial control simulations with (CHEM) and without (NOCHEM) interactive chemistry. In general, the influence of the chemistry on the mean state and the variability is small and mainly restricted to the stratosphere and mesosphere. The largest differences are found for the atmospheric dynamics in the polar regions, with slightly stronger northern and southern winter polar vortices in CHEM. The strengthening of the vortex is related to larger stratospheric temperature gradients, which are attributed to a parametrization of the absorption of ozone and oxygen in the Lyman-alpha, Schumann?Runge, Hartley, and Higgins bands. This effect is parametrized in the version with interactive chemistry only. A second reason for the temperature differences between CHEM and NOCHEM is related to diurnal variations in the ozone concentrations in the higher atmosphere, which are missing in NOCHEM. Furthermore, stratospheric water vapour concentrations differ substantially between the two experiments, but their effect on the temperatures is small. In both setups, the simulated intensity and variability of the northern polar vortex is inside the range of present day observations. Sudden stratospheric warming events are well reproduced in terms of their frequency, but the distribution amongst the winter months is too uniform.  Additionally, the performance of SOCOL-MPIOM under changing external forcings is assessed for the period 1600?2000 using an ensemble of simulations driven by a spectral solar forcing reconstruction. The amplitude of the reconstruction is large in comparison to other state-of-the-art reconstructions, providing an upper limit for the importance of the solar signal. In the pre-industrial period (1600?1850) the simulated surface temperature trends are in reasonable agreement with temperature reconstructions, although the multi-decadal variability is more pronounced. This enhanced variability can be attributed to the variability in the solar forcing. The simulated temperature reductions during the Maunder Minimum are in the lowest probability range of the proxy records. During the Dalton Minimum, when also volcanic forcing is an important driver of temperature variations, the agreement is better. In the industrial period from 1850 onward SOCOL-MPIOM overestimates the temperature increase in comparison to observational data sets. Sensitivity simulations show that this overestimation can be attributed to the increasing trend in the solar forcing reconstruction that is used in this study and an additional warming induced by the simulated ozone changes.";2014;"model, chemistry, climate, temperature, simulation"

Contemporaneously with the growing scientific community employing tree-ring parameters, recent research has suggested that commonly applied sampling designs (i.e. how and which trees are selected for dendrochronological sampling) may introduce considerable biases in quantifications of forest responses to environmental change. To date, a systematic assessment of the consequences of sampling design on dendroecological and-climatological conclusions has not yet been performed. Here, we investigate potential biases by sampling a large population of trees and replicating diverse sampling designs. This is achieved by retroactively subsetting the population and specifically testing for biases emerging for climate reconstruction, growth response to climate variability, long-term growth trends, and quantification of forest productivity. We find that commonly applied sampling designs can impart systematic biases of varying magnitude to any type of tree-ring-based investigations, independent of the total number of samples considered. Quantifications of forest growth and productivity are particularly susceptible to biases, whereas growth responses to short-term climate variability are less affected by the choice of sampling design. The world's most frequently applied sampling design, focusing on dominant trees only, can bias absolute growth rates by up to 459% and trends in excess of 200%. Our findings challenge paradigms, where a subset of samples is typically considered to be representative for the entire population. The only two sampling strategies meeting the requirements for all types of investigations are the (i) sampling of all individuals within a fixed area; and (ii) fully randomized selection of trees. This result advertises the consistent implementation of a widely applicable sampling design to simultaneously reduce uncertainties in tree-ring-based quantifications of forest growth and increase the comparability of datasets beyond individual studies, investigators, laboratories, and geographical boundaries.";2014;"tree-rings, biases, sampling, forest growth, climate"

In the present study, a variety of methods are applied at local level in different places in South Tyrol that aim at: (1) the assessment of future losses caused by the occurrence of debris flows by using a vulnerability curve, (2) the assessment of social vulnerability based on the risk awareness of the exposed people to floods, and (3) the assessment of spatial exposure and social vulnerability of the exposed population to heat waves. The results show that, in South Tyrol, the risk to a number of hazards can be reduced by: (1) improving documentation for past events in order to improve existing vulnerability curves and the assessment of future losses, (2) raising citizens' awareness and responsibility to improve coping capacity to floods, and (3) extending heat wave early warning systems to more low-lying areas of South Tyrol.";2014;"south tyrol, hazards, climate change, assessment, reduction"

Insights from Jatropha Production in Northeastern Ethiopia";"Brigitte Portner and Albrecht Ehrensperger and Zufan Nezir and Thomas Michael Breu and Hans Hurni";"Many observers view Jatropha as a miracle plant that grows in harsh environments, halts land degradation and provides seeds for fuel production. This makes it particularly attractive for use in Ethiopia, where poverty levels are high and the degradation of agricultural land is widespread. In this article, we investigate the potentials and limitations of a government-initiated Jatropha project for smallholders in northeastern Ethiopia from a green economy perspective. Data are based on a 2009 household survey and interviews with key informants, as well as on a 2012 follow-up round of interviews with key informants. We conclude that the project has not contributed to a greener economy so far, but has the potential to do so in the future. To maximize Jatropha?s potential, interventions must focus mainly on smallholders and pay more attention to the entire biofuel value chain.";2014;"jatropha, miracle, land, economy, smallholders"

Haimberger and Alexander Nicolas Stickler and Stefan Br{\"o";"Many observed time series of the global radiosonde or PILOT networks exist as fragments distributed over different archives. Identifying and merging these fragments can enhance their value for studies on the three-dimensional spatial structure of climate change.  The Comprehensive Historical Upper-Air Network (CHUAN version 1.7), which was substantially extended in 2013, and the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) are the most important collections of upper-air measurements taken before 1958. CHUAN (tracked) balloon data start in 1900, with higher numbers from the late 1920s onward, whereas IGRA data start in 1937. However, a substantial fraction of those measurements have not been taken at synoptic times (preferably 00:00 or 12:00 GMT) and on altitude levels instead of standard pressure levels. To make them comparable with more recent data, the records have been brought to synoptic times and standard pressure levels using state-of-the-art interpolation techniques, employing geopotential information from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) 20th Century Reanalysis (NOAA 20CR). From 1958 onward the European Re-Analysis archives (ERA-40 and ERA-Interim) available at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are the main data sources. These are easier to use, but pilot data still have to be interpolated to standard pressure levels. Fractions of the same records distributed over different archives have been merged, if necessary, taking care that the data remain traceable back to their original sources. If possible, station IDs assigned by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) have been allocated to the station records. For some records which have never been identified by a WMO ID, a local ID above 100 000 has been assigned. The merged data set contains 37 wind records longer than 70 years and 139 temperature records longer than 60 years. It can be seen as a useful basis for further data processing steps, most notably homogenization and gridding, after which it should be a valuable resource for climatological studies. Homogeneity adjustments for wind using the NOAA-20CR as a reference are described in Ramella Pralungo and Haimberger (2014). Reliable homogeneity adjustments for temperature beyond 1958 using a surface-data-only reanalysis such as NOAA-20CR as a reference have yet to be created.

Representing this complexity in the modeling process is a challenge that can be addressed by an interdisciplinary and holistic approach. The assessment of the water system of the Crans-Montana-Sierre area (Switzerland) and its evolution until 2050 were tackled by combining glaciological, hydrogeological, and hydrological measurements and modeling with the evaluation of water use through documentary, statistical and interview-based analyses. Four visions of future regional development were co-produced with a group of stakeholders and were then used as a basis for estimating future water demand. The comparison of the available water resource and the water demand at monthly time scale allowed us to conclude that for the four scenarios socioeconomic factors will impact on the future water systems more than climatic factors. An analysis of the sustainability of the current and future water systems based on four visions of regional development allowed us to identify those scenarios that will be more sustainable and that should be adopted by the decision-makers. The results were then presented to the stakeholders through five key messages. The challenges of communicating the results in such a way with stakeholders are discussed at the end of the article.";2014;"modeling, regional, complexity, water, scenarios"

In this paper we explore the scalar dimension of justice in water governance through the insights derived from empirical research on hydropower production in the Swiss Alps and the application of the geographical concept of politics of scale. More specifically, we investigate how different actors frame the justice problem, the scales that they invoke and which actors consequently get included or excluded in their justice assessments. This study shows that there is no ideal scale for justice evaluations; whichever scale is used, some actors and justice claims are included whereas others are excluded. This is particularly true when using Fraser?s trivalent concept of justice, taking into account issues of distribution, recognition and participation where each calls for its own set of scales. Moreover, focusing on the politics of scale framing, our study reveals that the justice claim itself can become a power element. Consequently, to achieve more just water governance, there is not only a need for debate and negotiations about the conceptions and meanings of justice in a specific context, there is also a need for debate about the relevance and implications of divergent scales involved in justice claims.";2014;"water, justice, scales, actors, governance"
"2502";"Envisioning sustainable water futures in a transdisciplinary learning process: combining normative, explorative, and participatory scenario approaches";"Flurina Schneider and Stephan Rist";"Competing water demands for household consumption as well as the production of food, energy, and other uses pose challenges for water supply and sustainable development in many parts of the world. Designing creative strategies and learning processes for sustainable water governance is thus of prime importance. While this need is uncontested, suitable approaches still have to be found. In this article we present and evaluate a conceptual approach to scenario building aimed at transdisciplinary learning for sustainable water governance. The approach combines normative, explorative, and participatory scenario elements. This combination allows for adequate consideration of stakeholders? and scientists? systems, target, and transformation knowledge. Application of the approach in the MontanAqua project in the Swiss Alps confirmed its high potential for co-producing new knowledge and establishing a meaningful and deliberative dialogue between all actors involved. The iterative and combined approach ensured that stakeholders? knowledge was adequately captured, fed into scientific analysis, and brought back to stakeholders in several cycles, thereby facilitating learning and co-production of new knowledge relevant for both stakeholders and scientists. However, the approach also revealed a number of constraints, including the enormous flexibility required of stakeholders and scientists in order for them to truly engage in the co-production of new knowledge. Overall, the study showed that shifts from strategic to communicative action are possible in an environment of mutual trust. This ultimately depends on creating conditions of interaction that place scientists? and stakeholders? knowledge on an equal footing.";2014;"water, governance, scenario, transdisciplinary, knowledge"

It contributes the ongoing discussions in political geography about the relation between politics/the political, space, and social change by showing how are spaces of politics brought into being through regulatory, citational practices and performances. The chapter explores how are hegemonic spaces of politics reproduced, constructed and contested by counter-hegemonic political practices and what kinds of spaces of politics result from politics of antagonism and what might an agonistic space of politics look like. The author argues that for realizing the potential of Butlers work for political geography, it is crucial to draw her writings in which she engages more directly with questions of social transformation, norms, politics, and democracy.

The objective of this study was to elucidate the contribution of species specific cutin and suberin biomarkers as proxies for shoot- and root-derived organic carbon (OC) to soil OM at different depths with increasing distance to the stems of four different tree species. Methods  The contribution of cutin- and suberin-derived lipids to OM in a Cutanic Alisol was analyzed with increasing soil depth and distance to the stems of Fagus sylvatica L., Picea abies (L.) Karst., Quercus robur L. and Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco. Cutin and suberin monomers of plants and soils were analyzed by alkaline hydrolysis and subsequent gas chromatography?mass spectrometry. Results  The amount and distribution of suberin-derived lipids in soil clearly reflected the specific root system of the different tree species. The amount of cutin-derived lipids decreased strongly with soil depth, indicating that the input of leaf/needle material is restricted to the topsoil. In contrast to the suberin-derived lipids, the spatial pattern of cutin monomer contribution to soil OM did not depend on tree species. Conclusions  Our results document the importance of tree species as a main factor controlling the composition and distribution of OM in forest soils. They reveal the impact of tree species on root-derived OM distribution and the necessity to distinguish among different zones when studying soil OM storage in forests.";2014;"tree, species, root, composition, soil"

Detailed semi-quantitative micromorphological analyses reveal the complex genesis of the palaeosols/pedocomplexes and the palaeoenvironmental conditions present during their formation. Our genetic model of landscape formation is underpinned with luminescence (post-IR IRSL) ages; the resulting chronological framework indicates that the basal loess sediment was deposited during marine isotope stage (MIS) 10. The overlying lower pedocomplex experienced a complex genesis in a forest-steppe environment during MIS 9. In the sand?loess sediment of MIS 8 a (forest-)steppe palaeosol (MIS 7) developed. The overlying MIS 6 loess sediment shows several intercalated Cryosols. The upper pedocomplex is a Chernozem (MIS 5c[?a?]) developed in a mixture of re-deposited Cambisol (attributed to MIS 5e), dust and local material.

This has increased societal and scientific interest in the intensity and frequency of historical high-impact storms. However, high-resolution wind data and damage statistics mostly span recent decades only.  For this study, we collected quantitative (e.g., volumes of windfall timber, losses relating to buildings) and descriptive (e.g., forestry or insurance reports) information on the impact of historical windstorms. To define windstorm severity, normalized and declustered quantitative data were processed by extreme value statistics. Descriptive information was classified using a conceptual guideline. Validation with independent damage information, as well as comparison with wind measurements and a reanalysis, indicates that the most hazardous winter storms are captured, while too few moderate windstorms are detected. Strong storms in the wind measurements and reanalysis are thus added to the catalog.  The final catalog encompasses approximately 240 high-impact windstorms in Switzerland since 1859. It features three robust severity classes and contains eight extreme windstorms. Evidence of high winter storm activity in the early and late 20th century compared to the mid-20th century in both damage and wind data indicates a co-variability of hazard and related damage on decadal timescales.";2014;"windstorms, switzerland, impact, severity, catalog"

Peter";"Geomagnetic excursions, i.e. short periods in time with much weaker geomagnetic fields and substantial changes in the position of the geomagnetic pole, occurred repeatedly in the Earth's history, e.g. the Laschamp event about 41 kyr ago. Although the next such excursion is certain to come, little is known about the timing and possible consequences for the state of the atmosphere and the ecosystems. Here we use the global chemistry climate model SOCOL-MPIOM to simulate the effects of geomagnetic excursions on atmospheric ionization, chemistry and dynamics. Our simulations show significantly increased concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the entire stratosphere, especially over Antarctica (+15%), due to enhanced ionization by galactic cosmic rays. Hydrogen oxides (HOx) are also produced in greater amounts (up to +40%) in the tropical and subtropical lower stratosphere, while their destruction by reactions with enhanced NOx prevails over the poles and in high altitudes (by ?5%). Stratospheric ozone concentrations decrease globally above 20 km by 1?2% and at the northern hemispheric tropopause by up to 5% owing to the accelerated NOx-induced destruction. A 5% increase is found in the southern lower stratosphere and troposphere. In response to these changes in ozone and the concomitant changes in atmospheric heating rates, the Arctic vortex intensifies in boreal winter, while the Antarctic vortex weakens in austral winter and spring. Surface wind anomalies show significant intensification of the southern westerlies at their poleward edge during austral winter and a pronounced northward shift in spring. Major impacts on the global climate seem unlikely.";2014;"geomagnetic, ionization, chemistry, dynamics, atmosphere"

M. van Lipzig";"The ability of the one-dimensional lake model FLake to represent the mixolimnion temperatures for tropical conditions was tested for three locations in East Africa: Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika's northern and southern basins. Meteorological observations from surrounding automatic weather stations were corrected and used to drive FLake, whereas a comprehensive set of water temperature profiles served to evaluate the model at each site. Careful forcing data correction and model configuration made it possible to reproduce the observed mixed layer seasonality at Lake Kivu and Lake Tanganyika (northern and southern basins), with correct representation of both the mixed layer depth and water temperatures. At Lake Kivu, mixolimnion temperatures predicted by FLake were found to be sensitive both to minimal variations in the external parameters and to small changes in the meteorological driving data, in particular wind velocity. In each case, small modifications may lead to a regime switch, from the correctly represented seasonal mixed layer deepening to either completely mixed or permanently stratified conditions from similar to 10 m downwards. In contrast, model temperatures were found to be robust close to the surface, with acceptable predictions of near-surface water temperatures even when the seasonal mixing regime is not reproduced. FLake can thus be a suitable tool to parameterise tropical lake water surface temperatures within atmospheric prediction models. Finally, FLake was used to attribute the seasonal mixing cycle at Lake Kivu to variations in the near-surface meteorological conditions. It was found that the annual mixing down to 60m during the main dry season is primarily due to enhanced lake evaporation and secondarily to the decreased incoming long wave radiation, both causing a significant heat loss from the lake surface and associated mixolimnion cooling.";2014;"model, temperatures, tropical, mixing, lake"

High-precipitation events are analyzed at Halvfarryggen situated in the coastal region of DML and at Kohnen Station located in its interior. This study further includes a comprehensive comparison of high precipitation in ERA-Interim with precipitation data from the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) and snow accumulation measurements from automatic weather stations (AWSs), with the limitations of such a comparison being discussed. The ERA-Interim and AMPS precipitation data agree very well. However, the correspondence between high precipitation in ERA-Interim and high snow accumulation at the AWSs is relatively weak. High-precipitation events at both Halvfarryggen and Kohnen are typically associated with amplified upper level waves. This large-scale atmospheric flow pattern is preceded by the downstream development of a Rossby wave train from the eastern South Pacific several days before the precipitation event. At the surface, a cyclone located over the Weddell Sea is the main synoptic ingredient for high precipitation both at Halvfarryggen and at Kohnen.

The combination of geographic and socio-eco - nomic data enables policymakers at all levels, development experts, and other interested readers to gain a spatial  understanding of dynamics affecting Kenya. Where is the informal economic sector most prominent? Which areas  have adequate water and sanitation? Where is population growth being slowed effectively? How do education levels  vary throughout the country? And where are poverty rates lowest? Answers to questions such as these, grouped into  seven broad themes, are visually illustrated on high-resolution maps. By supplying precise information at the sub-location level and summarizing it at the county level, the atlas facilitates  better planning that accounts for local contexts and needs. It is a valuable decision-support tool for government  institutions at different administrative levels, educational institutions, and others. Three organizations ? two in Kenya and one in Switzerland ? worked together to create the atlas: the Kenya National  Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), the Nanyuki-based Centre for Training and Integrated Research in ASAL Development  (CETRAD), and the Centre for Development and Environment (CDE) at the University of Bern.

A key recently completed first step has been collating all available records into a comprehensive open access, traceable and version-controlled databank. The crucial next step is to maximise the value of the collated data through a robust international framework of benchmarking and assessment for product intercomparison and uncertainty estimation. We focus on uncertainties arising from the presence of inhomogeneities in monthly mean land surface temperature data and the varied methodological choices made by various groups in building homogeneous temperature products. The central facet of the benchmarking process is the creation of global-scale synthetic analogues to the real-world database where both the \"true\" series and inhomogeneities are known (a luxury the real-world data do not afford us). Hence, algorithmic strengths and weaknesses can be meaningfully quantified and conditional inferences made about the real-world climate system. Here we discuss the necessary framework for developing an international homogenisation benchmarking system on the global scale for monthly mean temperatures. The value of this framework is critically dependent upon the number of groups taking part and so we strongly advocate involvement in the benchmarking exercise from as many data analyst groups as possible to make the best use of this substantial effort.";2014;"international, temperature, homogenisation, benchmarking, uncertainty"

However, the effects of biodiversity on soil water fluxes remain poorly understood for native tree species plantations in the tropics. Therefore, we estimated soil water fluxes and assessed the effects of tree species and diversity on these fluxes in an experimental native tree species plantation in Sardinilla (Panama). The study was conducted during the wet season 2008 on plots of monocultures and mixtures of three or six tree species. Rainfall and soil water content were measured and evapotranspiration was estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation. Soil water fluxes were estimated using a simple soil water budget model considering water input, output, and soil water and groundwater storage changes and in addition, were simulated using the physically based one-dimensional water flow model Hydrus-1D.  In general, the Hydrus simulation did not reflect the observed pressure heads, in that modeled pressure heads were higher compared to measured ones.

A better understanding of people?s knowledge and valuation of woody species can help to adjust actor-oriented agroforestry systems. In this case study, carried out in a peasant community of the Bolivian Andes, we aimed at calculating the cultural importance of selected agroforestry species, and at analysing the intracultural variation in the cultural importance and knowledge of plants according to peasants? sex, age, and migration. Methods Data collection was based on semi-structured interviews and freelisting exercises. Two ethnobotanical indices (Composite Salience, Cultural Importance) were used for calculating the cultural importance of plants. Intracultural variation in the cultural importance and knowledge of plants was detected by using linear and generalised linear (mixed) models. Results and discussion The culturally most important woody species were mainly trees and exotic species (e.g. Schinus molle, Prosopis laevigata, Eucalyptus globulus). We found that knowledge and valuation of plants increased with age but that they were lower for migrants; sex, by contrast, played a minor role. The age effects possibly result from decreasing ecological apparency of valuable native species, and their substitution by exotic marketable trees, loss of traditional plant uses or the use of other materials (e.g. plastic) instead of wood. Decreasing dedication to traditional farming may have led to successive abandonment of traditional tool uses, and the overall transformation of woody plant use is possibly related to diminishing medicinal knowledge. Conclusions Age and migration affect how people value woody species and what they know about their uses. For this reason, we recommend paying particular attention to the potential of native species, which could open promising perspectives especially for the young migrating peasant generation and draw their interest in agroforestry. These native species should be ecologically sound and selected on their potential to provide subsistence and promising commercial uses. In addition to offering socio-economic and environmental services, agroforestry initiatives using native trees and shrubs can play a crucial role in recovering elements of the lost ancient landscape that still forms part of local people?s collective identity.";2013;"agroforestry, cultural importance, intracultural variation, native species, migration"

Tragic wildfires and a predicted increase in high fire danger weather with climate change have triggered concern for the safety of such amenity-led migrants in wildfire-prone landscapes.  This book examines wildfire awareness and preparedness amongst women, men, households, communities and agencies at the interface between city and beyond. It does so through an examination of two regions where wildfires are common and disastrous, and where how to deal with them is a major political issue: southeast Australia and the west coast United States. It follows women?s and men?s stories of surviving, fighting, evacuating, living and working with wildfire to reveal the intimate inner workings of wildfire response ? and especially the culturally and historically distinct gender relations that underpin wildfire resilience.  Wildfire is revealed as much more than a \"natural\" hazard ? it is far from gender-neutral. Rather, wildfire is an important means through which traditional gender roles and power relations are maintained despite changing social circumstances. Women?s and men?s subjectivities are shaped by varying senses of inclusion, exclusion, engagement and disengagement with wildfire management. This leads to the reproduction of gender identities with clear ramifications for if, how and to what extent women and men prepare for wildfire.";2013;"lifestyle, property, nature, wildfires, gender"

Dubinkina";"The mid-Holocene (6 kyr BP; thousand years before present) is a key period to study the consistency between model results and proxy-based reconstruction data as it corresponds to a standard test for models and a reasonable number of proxy-based records is available. Taking advantage of this relatively large amount of information, we have compared a compilation of 50 air and sea surface temperature reconstructions with the results of three simulations performed with general circulation models and one carried out with LOVECLIM, a model of intermediate complexity. The conclusions derived from this analysis confirm that models and data agree on the large-scale spatial pattern but the models underestimate the magnitude of some observed changes and that large discrepancies are observed at the local scale. To further investigate the origin of those inconsistencies, we have constrained LOVECLIM to follow the signal recorded by the proxies selected in the compilation using a data-assimilation method based on a particle filter. In one simulation, all the 50 proxy-based records are used while in the other two only the continental or oceanic proxy-based records constrain the model results. As expected, data assimilation leads to improving the consistency between model results and the reconstructions. In particular, this is achieved in a robust way in all the experiments through a strengthening of the westerlies at midlatitude that warms up northern Europe. Furthermore, the comparison of the LOVECLIM simulations with and without data assimilation has also objectively identified 16 proxy-based paleoclimate records whose reconstructed signal is either incompatible with the signal recorded by some other proxy-based records or with model physics.";2013;"data assimilation, mid-holocene, model results, proxy-based reconstructions, inconsistencies"

With the anticipated climate change, it is likely that plant production ? and thus the fodder basis for the cattle ? will be influenced. Investigating the dependence of biomass production on topoclimatic factors will allow us to better understand how anticipated climate change may influence this traditional Alpine farming system. Because small-scale topoclimatological variations of the main meteorological variables: temperature, humidity, precipitation, shortwave incoming radiation and wind speed are not easily derived from available long-term climate stations in mountainous terrain, it was our goal to investigate the topoclimatic variations over the pastures belonging to the Alp Weissenstein research station north of the Albula Pass in the eastern Swiss Alps. We present a basic assessment of current topoclimatic conditions as a site characterization for ongoing ecological climate change studies. To be able to link short-term studies with long-term climate records, we related agrometeorological measurements with those of surrounding long-term sites run by MeteoSwiss, both on valley bottoms (Davos, Samedan), and on mountain tops (Weissfluhjoch, Piz Corvatsch). We found that the Davos climate station north of the study area is most closely correlated with the local climate of Alp Weissenstein, although a much closer site (Samedan) exists on the other side of the Albula Pass. Mountain top stations, however, did not provide a convincing approximation for the climate at Alp Weissenstein. Direct comparisons of near-surface measurements from a set of 11 small weather stations distributed over the domain where cattle and sheep are grazed indicate that nocturnal minimum air temperature and minimum vapor pressure deficit are mostly governed by the altitudinal gradient, whereas daily maxima ? including also wind speed ? are more strongly depending on vegetation cover and less on the altitude.";2013;"alpine, fodder, climate change, biomass production, topoclimatic"

Mu{~n";"The near-surface wind and temperature regime at three points in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile is described using two-year multi-level measurements from 80-m towers located in an altitude range between 2100 and 2700 m ASL. The data reveal the frequent development of strong nocturnal drainage flows at all sites. Down-valley nose-shaped wind speed profiles are observed with maximum values occurring at heights between 20 m and 60 m AGL. The flow intensity shows considerable inter-daily variability and a seasonal modulation of maximum speeds, which in the cold season can attain hourly average values larger than 20 m s?1. Turbulent mixing appears significant over the full tower layer, affecting the curvature of the nighttime temperature profile and possibly explaining the observed increase of surface temperatures in the down-valley direction. Nocturnal valley winds and temperatures are weakly controlled by upper-air conditions observed at the nearest aerological station. Estimates of terms in the momentum budget for the development and the quasi-stationary phases of the down-valley flows suggest that the pressure gradient force due to the near-surface cooling along the sloping valley axes plays an important role in these drainage flows. A scale for the jet nose height of equilibrium turbulent down-slope jets is proposed, based on surface friction velocity and surface inversion intensity. At one of the sites this scale explains about 70% of the case-to-case observed variance of jet nose heights. Further modeling and observational work is needed, however, in order to better define the dynamics, extent and turbulence structure of this flow system, which has significant wind-energy, climatic and environmental implications.";2013;"desert, wind, temperature, turbulence, environment"

In little-industrialized and remote areas, in contrast, a larger part of N cycling occurs as dissolved organic N (DON). In a north Andean tropical montane forest in Ecuador, the N cycle changed markedly during 1998?2010 along with increasing N deposition and reduced soil moisture. The DON concentrations and the fractional contribution of DON to total N significantly decreased in rainfall, throughfall, and soil solutions. This inorganic turn of the N cycle was most pronounced in rainfall and became weaker along the flow path of water through the system until it disappeared in stream water. Decreasing organic contributions to N cycling were caused not only by increasing inorganic N input but also by reduced DON production and/or enhanced DON decomposition. Accelerated DON decomposition might be attributable to less waterlogging and higher nutrient availability. Significantly increasing NO3-N concentrations and NO3-N/NH4-N concentration ratios in throughfall and litter leachate below the thick organic layers indicated increasing nitrification. In mineral soil solutions, in contrast, NH4-N concentrations increased and NO3-N/NH4-N concentration ratios decreased significantly, suggesting increasing net ammonification. Our results demonstrate that the remote tropical montane forests on the rim of the Amazon basin experienced a pronounced change of the N cycle in only one decade.

B{'e";"Breaking synoptic-scale Rossby waves (RWB) at the tropopause level are central to the daily weather evolution in the extratropics and the subtropics. RWB leads to pronounced meridional transport of heat, moisture, momentum, and chemical constituents. RWB events are manifest as elongated and narrow structures in the tropopause-level potential vorticity (PV) field. A feature-based validation approach is used to assess the representation of Northern Hemisphere RWB in present-day climate simulations carried out with the ECHAM5-HAM climate model at three different resolutions (T42L19, T63L31, and T106L31) against the ERA-40 reanalysis data set. An objective identification algorithm extracts RWB events from the isentropic PV field and allows quantifying the frequency of occurrence of RWB. The biases in the frequency of RWB are then compared to biases in the time mean tropopause-level jet wind speeds. The ECHAM5-HAM model captures the location of the RWB frequency maxima in the Northern Hemisphere at all three resolutions. However, at coarse resolution (T42L19) the overall frequency of RWB, i.e. the frequency averaged over all seasons and the entire hemisphere, is underestimated by 28%.The higher-resolution simulations capture the overall frequency of RWB much better, with a minor difference between T63L31 and T106L31 (frequency errors of ?3.5 and 6%, respectively). The number of large-size RWB events is significantly underestimated by the T42L19 experiment and well represented in the T106L31 simulation. On the local scale, however, significant differences to ERA-40 are found in the higher-resolution simulations. These differences are regionally confined and vary with the season. The most striking difference between T106L31 and ERA-40 is that ECHAM5-HAM overestimates the frequency of RWB in the subtropical Atlantic in all seasons except for spring.

We carried out several sensitivity ensemble experiments to separate the effects of (i) reduced solar ultra-violet (UV) irradiance, (ii) reduced solar visible and near infrared irradiance, (iii) enhanced galactic cosmic ray intensity as well as less intensive solar energetic proton events and auroral electron precipitation, and (iv) volcanic aerosols. The introduced changes of UV irradiance and volcanic aerosols significantly influence stratospheric dynamics in the early 19th century, whereas changes in the visible part of the spectrum and energetic particles have smaller effects. A reduction of UV irradiance by 15%, which represents the presently discussed highest estimate of UV irradiance change caused by solar activity changes, causes global ozone decrease below the stratopause reaching as much as 8% in the midlatitudes at 5 hPa and a significant stratospheric cooling of up to 2 ?C in the mid-stratosphere and to 6 ?C in the lower mesosphere. Changes in energetic particle precipitation lead only to minor changes in the yearly averaged temperature fields in the stratosphere. Volcanic aerosols heat the tropical lower stratosphere, allowing more water vapour to enter the tropical stratosphere, which, via HOx reactions, decreases upper stratospheric and mesospheric ozone by roughly 4%. Conversely, heterogeneous chemistry on aerosols reduces stratospheric NOx, leading to a 12% ozone increase in the tropics, whereas a decrease in ozone of up to 5% is found over Antarctica in boreal winter. The linear superposition of the different contributions is not equivalent to the response obtained in a simulation when all forcing factors are applied during the Dalton Minimum (DM) ? this effect is especially well visible for NOx/NOy. Thus, this study also shows the non-linear behaviour of the coupled chemistry-climate system. Finally, we conclude that especially UV and volcanic eruptions dominate the changes in the ozone, temperature and dynamics while the NOx field is dominated by the energetic particle precipitation.

Most of the early observations, which have now been digitized, are prone to a large variety of undocumented uncertainties (errors) that need to be quantified, e.g., for their assimilation in reanalysis projects.

"2561";"Linking local knowledge, conservation practices and ecosystem diversity: comparing two communities in the Tunari National Park (Bolivia)";"S{'e";"Combined approaches to conserve both biological and cultural diversity are seen as an alternative to classical nature conservation instruments. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of urbanization coupled with exclusive conservation measures, on land use, local knowledge and biodiversity in two Quechua speaking communities of Bolivia located within the Tunari National Park. We assessed and compared the links between land use, its transformation through conservation practices, local institutions and the worldviews of both communities and the implications they have for biodiversity at the level of ecosystems. Our results show that in both communities, people?s worldviews and environmental knowledge are linked with an integral and diversified use of their territory. However, the community most affected by urbanization and protected area regulations has intensified agriculture in a small area and has abandoned the use of large areas. This was accompanied by a loss of local environmental knowledge and a decrease in the diversity of ecosystems. The second community, where the park was not enforced, continues to manage their territory as a material expression of local environmental knowledge, while adopting community-based conservation measures with external support. Our findings highlight a case in which urbanization coupled with exclusive conservation approaches affects the components of both cultural and biological diversity. Actions that aim to enhance biocultural diversity in this context should therefore address the impact of factors identified as responsible for change in integrated social-ecological systems.";2013;"urbanization, biodiversity, conservation, knowledge, communities"
"2562";"Climate and chemistry effects of a regional scale nuclear conflict";"A. Stenke and C. R. Hoyle and B. Luo and E. Rozanov and J. Gr{\"o";"Previous studies have highlighted the severity of detrimental effects for life on earth after an assumed regionally limited nuclear war. These effects are caused by climatic, chemical and radiative changes persisting for up to one decade. However, so far only a very limited number of climate model simulations have been performed, giving rise to the question how realistic previous computations have been. This study uses the coupled chemistry climate model (CCM) SOCOL, which belongs to a different family of CCMs than previously used, to investigate the consequences of such a hypothetical nuclear conflict. In accordance with previous studies, the present work assumes a scenario of a nuclear conflict between India and Pakistan, each applying 50 warheads with an individual blasting power of 15 kt (\"Hiroshima size\") against the major population centers, resulting in the emission of tiny soot particles, which are generated in the firestorms expected in the aftermath of the detonations. Substantial uncertainties related to the calculation of likely soot emissions, particularly concerning assumptions of target fuel loading and targeting of weapons, have been addressed by simulating several scenarios, with soot emissions ranging from 1 to 12 Tg. Their high absorptivity with respect to solar radiation leads to a rapid self-lofting of the soot particles into the strato- and mesosphere within a few days after emission, where they remain for several years. Consequently, the model suggests earth's surface temperatures to drop by several degrees Celsius due to the shielding of solar irradiance by the soot, indicating a major global cooling. In addition, there is a substantial reduction of precipitation lasting 5 to 10 yr after the conflict, depending on the magnitude of the initial soot release. Extreme cold spells associated with an increase in sea ice formation are found during Northern Hemisphere winter, which expose the continental land masses of North America and Eurasia to a cooling of several degrees. In the stratosphere, the strong heating leads to an acceleration of catalytic ozone loss and, consequently, to enhancements of UV radiation at the ground. In contrast to surface temperature and precipitation changes, which show a linear dependence to the soot burden, there is a saturation effect with respect to stratospheric ozone chemistry. Soot emissions of 5 Tg lead to an ozone column reduction of almost 50% in northern high latitudes, while emitting 12 Tg only increases ozone loss by a further 10%. In summary, this study, though using a different chemistry climate model, corroborates the previous investigations with respect to the atmospheric impacts. In addition to these persistent effects, the present study draws attention to episodically cold phases, which would likely add to the severity of human harm worldwide. The best insurance against such a catastrophic development would be the delegitimization of nuclear weapons.";2013;"nuclear, climate, model, soot, cooling"

Important aspects of this debate are to establish to what extent the rise of social complexity was influenced by the local geo-ecology; and what productive strategies were adopted in order to sustain these societies. The Llanos de Moxos (LM), in the Bolivian Amazon, is a vast floodplain made up of a variety of geo-ecological sub regions that host many different types of pre-Columbian earthworks. Therefore, it offers an excellent opportunity to compare different kinds of archaeological landscapes and their relationship to different pre-Columbian cultures and environmental settings. This paper analyses the links between pre-Columbian earthworks and the local geo-ecology in two regions of the LM: 1) the platform field region (PFR) in the north of Santa Ana de Yacuma, where the highest concentration of raised fields has been documented, and 2) the monumental mounds region (MMR) south and east of Trinidad, where {ensuremath{>";2013;"amazonia, reconstruction, past, pre-columbian, earthworks"

Croci-Maspoli and M. Graf and E. Madonna and B. Mueller and S. Schemm and J. Sedl{'a";"In July and August 2010 floods of unprecedented impact afflicted Pakistan. The floods resulted from a series of intense multi-day precipitation events in July and early August. At the same time a series of blocking anticyclones dominated the upper-level flow over western Russia and breaking waves i.e. equatorward extrusions of stratospheric high potential vorticity (PV) air formed along the downstream flank of the blocks. Previous studies suggested that these extratropical upper-level breaking waves were crucial for instigating the precipitation events in Pakistan. Here a detailed analysis is provided of the extratropical forcing of the precipitation. Piecewise PV inversion is used to quantify the extratropical upper-level forcing associated with the wave breaking and trajectories are calculated to study the pathways and source regions of the moisture that precipitated over Pakistan. Limited-area model simulations are carried out to complement the Lagrangian analysis.  The precipitation events over Pakistan resulted from a combination of favourable boundary conditions with strong extratropical and monsoonal forcing factors. Above-normal sea-surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean led to an elevated lower-tropospheric moisture content. Surface monsoonal depressions ensured the transport of moist air from the ocean towards northeastern Pakistan. Along this pathway the air parcel humidity increased substantially (60?90% of precipitated moisture) via evapotranspiration from the land surface. Extratropical breaking waves influenced the surface wind field substantially by enhancing the wind component directed towards the mountains which reinforced the precipitation.";2013;"extratropical, precipitation, waves, blocking, moisture"

In this study, potential vorticity (PV) streamers serve to examine the flow condition leading to cold surges. Case studies suggest that several PV anomalies are related to cold surge episodes: (1) the potential vorticity unit (2-PVU) isoline upstream of South America becomes progressively more distorted prior and during the cold surge episode, indicating a flow situation which is conducive for Rossby wave breaking and hence a flow which strongly deviates from zonality; (2) the initial stage of a cold surge episode is characterized by a northward bulging of high-PV air to the east of the Andes, resulting in a PV streamer whose northern end reaches Uruguay and southeastern Brazil; the strong PV gradient on its western flank constitutes a flow configuration that induces and maintains the transport of sub-Antarctic air toward the subtropics; (3) a distinct negative PV anomaly, a blocking, originates over the eastern South Pacific, upstream of the South America sector. A composite analysis of 27 cold surges is performed for stratospheric PV streamer frequency on several isentropic surfaces. It reveals that equatorward wave breaking over South America and the western South Atlantic represents an important potential component of the dynamics of intense cold surges. The indications are most pronounced around the isentropic levels of 320-K and immediately before the day with largest temperature drops over subtropical Brazil.";2013;"cold, streamer, surge, flow, dynamics"

It is based on a new approach that combines information from an ensemble of chemistry climate model (CCM) simulations with historical total column ozone information. The CCM simulations incorporate important external drivers of stratospheric chemistry and dynamics (in particular solar and volcanic effects, greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances, sea surface temperatures, and the quasi-biennial oscillation). The historical total column ozone observations include ground-based measurements from the 1920s onward and satellite observations from 1970 to 1976. An off-line data assimilation approach is used to combine model simulations, observations, and information on the observation error. The period starting in 1979 was used for validation with existing ozone data sets and therefore only ground-based measurements were assimilated. Results demonstrate considerable skill from the CCM simulations alone. Assimilating observations provides additional skill for total column ozone. With respect to the vertical ozone distribution, assimilating observations increases on average the correlation with a reference data set, but does not decrease the mean squared error.

Here, we compiled and analyzed 115 417 weekly fungal fruit body counts from permanent Swiss inventories between 1975 and 2006. Mushroom fruiting exhibited an average autumnal delay of 12 days after 1991 compared with before, the annual number of fruit bodies increased from 1801 to 5414 and the mean species richness doubled from 10 to 20. Intra- and interannual coherency of symbiotic and saprotrophic mushroom fruiting, together with little agreement between mycorrhizal yield and tree growth suggests direct climate controls on fruit body formation of both nutritional modes. Our results contradict a previously reported declining of mushroom harvests and propose rethinking the conceptual role of symbiotic pathways in fungi-host interaction. Moreover, this conceptual advancement may foster new cross-disciplinary research avenues, and stimulate questions about possible amplifications of the global carbon cycle, as enhanced fungal production in moist mid-latitude forests rises carbon cycling and thus increases greenhouse gas exchanges between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere.";2013;"biotic, abiotic, mycelial, fruiting, climate"

However, in cool-arid environments, precipitation is not the only limitation to forest productivity. Interactions between changes in precipitation and air temperature may enhance soil moisture stress while simultaneously extending growing season length, with unclear consequences for net carbon uptake. This study evaluates recent trends in productivity and phenology of Inner Asian forests (in Mongolia and Northern China) using satellite remote sensing, dendrochronology, and dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) simulations to quantify the sensitivity of forest dynamics to decadal climate variability and trends. Trends in photosynthetically active radiation fraction (FPAR) between 1982 and 2010 show a greening of about 7% of the region in spring (March, April, May), and 3% of the area ?browning? during summertime (June, July, August). These satellite observations of FPAR are corroborated by trends in NPP simulated by the LPJ DGVM. Spring greening trends in FPAR are mainly explained by long-term trends in precipitation whereas summer browning trends are correlated with decreasing precipitation. Tree ring data from 25 sites confirm annual growth increments are mainly limited by summer precipitation (June, July, August) in Mongolia, and spring precipitation in northern China (March, April, May), with relatively weak prior-year lag effects. An ensemble of climate projections from the IPCC CMIP3 models indicates that warming temperatures (spring, summer) are expected to be associated with higher summer precipitation, which combined with CO2 causes large increases in NPP and possibly even greater forest cover in the Mongolian steppe. In the absence of a strong direct CO2 fertilization effect on plant growth (e.g., due to nutrient limitation), water stress or decreased carbon gain from higher autotrophic respiration results in decreased productivity and loss of forest cover. The fate of these semi-arid ecosystems thus appears to hinge upon the magnitude and subtleties of CO2 fertilization effects, for which experimental observations in arid systems are needed to test and refine vegetation models.";2013;"semi-arid, ecosystem, precipitation, temperature, forest"

Multidisciplinary research in forest islands situated in seasonally-inundated savannahs has revealed stratified shell middens produced by human foragers as early as 10,000 years ago, making them the oldest archaeological sites in the region. The absence of stone resources and partial burial by recent alluvial sediments has meant that these kinds of deposits have, until now, remained unidentified. We conducted core sampling, archaeological excavations and an interdisciplinary study of the stratigraphy and recovered materials from three shell midden mounds. Based on multiple lines of evidence, including radiocarbon dating, sedimentary proxies (elements, steroids and black carbon), micromorphology and faunal analysis, we demonstrate the anthropogenic origin and antiquity of these sites. In a tropical and geomorphologically active landscape often considered challenging both for early human occupation and for the preservation of hunter-gatherer sites, the newly discovered shell middens provide evidence for early to middle Holocene occupation and illustrate the potential for identifying and interpreting early open-air archaeological sites in western Amazonia.

We compare the results with a 28-member ensemble of European Centre/Hamburg version 5.4 (ECHAM5.4) general circulation model simulations. Eight stratospheric volcanic eruptions during the instrumental period are investigated. Seasonal all- and clear-sky DTR anomalies are compared with contemporary (approximately 20-year) reference periods. Clear sky is used to eliminate cloud effects and better estimate the signal from the direct radiative forcing of the volcanic aerosols. We do not find a consistent effect of stratospheric aerosols on all-sky DTR. For clear skies, we find average DTR anomalies of ?0.08?C (?0.13?C) in the observations (in the model), with the largest effect in the second winter after the eruption. Although the clear-sky DTR anomalies from different stations, volcanic eruptions, and seasons show heterogeneous signals in terms of order of magnitude and sign, the significantly negative DTR anomalies (e.g., after the Tambora eruption) are qualitatively consistent with other studies. Referencing with clear-sky DTR anomalies to the radiative forcing from stratospheric volcanic eruptions, we find the resulting sensitivity to be of the same order of magnitude as previously published estimates for tropospheric aerosols during the so-called ?global dimming? period (i.e., 1950s to 1980s). Analyzing cloud cover changes after volcanic eruptions reveals an increase in clear-sky days in both data sets.

Consequently, future seasonal water availability might become scarce once glacier areas have declined below a certain threshold affecting future water management strategies. Particular attention should be paid to glaciers located in a karstic environment, as parts of the meltwater can be drained by underlying karst systems, making it difficult to assess water availability. In this study tracer experiments, karst modeling and glacier melt modeling are combined in order to identify flow paths in a high alpine, glacierized, karstic environment (Glacier de la Plaine Morte, Switzerland) and to investigate current and predict future downstream water availability. Flow paths through the karst underground were determined with natural and fluorescent tracers. Subsequently, geologic information and the findings from tracer experiments were assembled in a karst model. Finally, glacier melt projections driven with a climate scenario were performed to discuss future water availability in the area surrounding the glacier. The results suggest that during late summer glacier meltwater is rapidly drained through well-developed channels at the glacier bottom to the north of the glacier, while during low flow season meltwater enters into the karst and is drained to the south.

In order to mitigate eutrophication, wastewater treatment plants, including Fe-induced phosphorus precipitation, were implemented throughout the industrialized world, leading to reoligotrophication in many freshwater lakes. To understand and assess the effects of reoligotrophication on primary productivity, we analyzed 28 years of 14C assimilation rates, as well as other biotic and abiotic parameters, such as global radiation, nutrient concentrations and plankton densities in peri-alpine Lake Lucerne, Switzerland. Using a simple productivity-light relationship, we estimated continuous primary production and discussed the relation between productivity and observed limnological parameters. Furthermore, we assessed the uncertainty of our modeling approach based on monthly 14C assimilation measurements using Monte Carlo simulations. Results confirm that monthly sampling of productivity is sufficient for identifying long-term trends in productivity and that conservation management has successfully improved water quality during the past three decades via reducing nutrients and primary production in the lake. However, even though nutrient concentrations have remained constant in recent years, annual primary production varies significantly from year to year. Despite the fact that nutrient concentrations have decreased by more than an order of magnitude, primary production has decreased only slightly. These results suggest that primary production correlates well to nutrients availability but meteorological conditions lead to interannual variability regardless of the trophic status of the lake. Accordingly, in oligotrophic freshwaters meteorological forcing may reduce productivity impacting on the entire food chain of the ecosystem.";2013;"sewage, reoligotrophication, productivity, uncertainty, variability"

The magnitude of mean seasonal temperature changes over the European land areas locally exceeds 1 K in the lower troposphere over a sunspot cycle.  We also analyse surface data to address the question whether the solar signal over Europe is temporally stable for a longer 250 yr period. The results increase our confidence in the existence of an influence of the 11 yr cycle on the European climate, but the signal is much weaker in the first half of the period compared to the second half.

Location  Europe and North Africa (30?70?-N, 10?-W?40?-E).  Methods  We compiled close to 1000 annually resolved records of radial tree growth for all major European tree species and quantified changes in growth as a function of historical climatic variation. Sites were grouped using a neural network clustering technique to isolate spatiotemporal and species-specific climate response patterns. The resulting empirical climate sensitivities were compared with the sensitivities of net primary production (NPP) estimates derived from the ORCHIDEE-FM and LPJ-wsl dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs).  Results  We found coherent biogeographic patterns in climate response that depend upon (1) phylogenetic controls and (2) ambient environmental conditions delineated by latitudinal/elevational location. Temperature controls dominate forest productivity in high-elevation and high-latitude areas whereas moisture sensitive sites are widespread at low elevation in central and southern Europe. DGVM simulations broadly reproduce the empirical patterns, but show less temperature sensitivity in the boreal zone and stronger precipitation sensitivity towards the mid-latitudes.  Main conclusions  Large-scale forest productivity is driven by monthly to seasonal climate controls, but our results emphasize species-specific growth patterns under comparable environmental conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that carry-over effects from the previous growing season can significantly influence tree growth, particularly in areas with harsh climatic conditions ? an element not considered in most current-state DGVMs. Model?data discrepancies suggest that the simulated climate sensitivity of NPP will need refinement before carbon-cycle climate feedbacks can be accurately quantified.";2013;"climate sensitivity, tree-ring network, species-specific, environmental conditions, growth patterns"

Over the last 100 years, various revegetation and restoration measures were taken on large areas distributed all over Iceland in an attempt to counteract this problem. The present research aimed to develop models for estimating percent vegetation cover (VC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) based on satellite data, as this would make it possible to assess and monitor the effectiveness of restoration measures over large areas at a fairly low cost. Models were developed based on 203 vegetation cover samples and 114 aboveground biomass samples distributed over five SPOT satellite datasets. All satellite datasets were atmospherically corrected, and digital numbers were converted into ground reflectance. Then a selection of vegetation indices (VIs) was calculated, followed by simple and multiple linear regression analysis of the relations between the field data and the calculated VIs.  Best results were achieved using multiple linear regression models for both %VC and AGB. The model calibration and validation results showed that R2 and RMSE values for most VIs do not vary very much. For percent VC, R2 values range between 0.789 and 0.822, leading to RMSEs ranging between 15.89% and 16.72%.

However, this topic has received relatively little attention compared to As behaviour in soils and biotransformation through the trophic level in the marine and terrestrial environment. We believe this is due to long-standing misconceptions regarding volatile As stability and transport as well as an absence, until recently, of appropriate sampling methods. First and foremost, an attempt is made to unify arsines' designations, notations and formulas, taking into account all the different terms used in the literature. Then, the stability of As volatile species is discussed and new analytical developments are explored. Further, the special cases of diffuse low-level emissions (e.g. soil and sediment biovolatilisation), and point sources with high-level emissions (geothermal environments, landfills, and natural gas) are comprehensively reviewed. In each case, future possible areas of research and unknown mechanisms are identified and their importance towards the global As biogeochemical cycle is explored. This review gathers new information regarding mechanisms, stability, transport and sampling of the very elusive arsines and shows that more research should be conducted on this important process.";2013;"microorganisms, arsines, stability, transport, sampling"

Arsenic undergoes many different transformations (biotic or abiotic) between and within environmental compartments, leading to a number of different chemical species possessing different properties and toxicities. One specific transformation is As biotic volatilization which is coupled with As biomethylation and has been scarcely studied due to inherent sampling issues. Arsenic methylation/volatilization is also linked with methanogenesis and occurs in anaerobic environments.  In China, rice straw and animal manure are very often used to produce biogas and both can contain high amounts of As, especially if the rice is grown in areas with heavy mining or smelting industries and if Roxarsone is fed to the animals. Roxarsone is an As-containing drug which is widely used in China to control coccidian intestinal parasites, to improve feed efficiency and to promote rapid growth. Previous work has shown that this compound degrades to inorganic As under anaerobic conditions. In this study the focus is on biotic transformations of As in small microcosms designed as biogas digester models (BDMs) using recently validated As traps, thus, enabling direct quantification and identification of volatile As species. It is shown that although there was a loss of soluble As in the BDMs, their conditions favored biomethylation.

In remote rural areas of the humid or semihumid tropics, forests represent an important resource for livelihoods. In countries like Laos, where most primary forest has been converted to secondary forest, and where an intricate and interlinked mosaic of forest and farmland prevails, people depend on secondary forests as a prime source of goods and services. The linkages between local livelihoods and secondary forest resources are subject to changes caused by improving accessibility. This article studies how accessibility affects the condition of forests and local livelihoods by comparing three villages along a gradient of accessibility in Phonxay district, Luang Prabang province, northern Laos. The results of this research show that accessibility strengthens the influence of the government and of markets, and that local livelihoods improve with increasing accessibility, while forest condition deteriorates.";2013;"rural, livelihoods, forests, accessibility, markets"

Alewell";"The mean transit time (MTT) of water in a catchment gives information about storage, flow paths, sources of water and thus also about retention and release of solutes in a catchment. To our knowledge there are only a few catchment studies on the influence of vegetation cover changes on base flow MTTs. The main changes in vegetation cover in the Swiss Alps are massive shrub encroachment and forest expansion into formerly open habitats. Four small and relatively steep headwater catchments in the Swiss Alps (Ursern Valley) were investigated to relate different vegetation cover to water transit times.  Time series of water stable isotopes were used to calculate MTTs. The high temporal variation of the stable isotope signals in precipitation was strongly dampened in stream base flow samples. MTTs of the four catchments were 70 to 102 weeks. The strong dampening of the stable isotope input signal as well as stream water geochemistry points to deeper flow paths and mixing of waters of different ages at the catchments' outlets. MTTs were neither related to topographic indices nor vegetation cover. The major part of the quickly infiltrating precipitation likely percolates through fractured and partially karstified deeper rock zones, which increases the control of bedrock flow paths on MTT. Snow accumulation and the timing of its melt play an important role for stable isotope dynamics during spring and early summer.  We conclude that, in mountainous headwater catchments with relatively shallow soil layers, the hydrogeological and geochemical patterns (i.e. geochemistry, porosity and hydraulic conductivity of rocks) and snow dynamics influence storage, mixing and release of water in a stronger way than vegetation cover or topography do.";2013;"transit, vegetation, isotope, rock, snow"

Sustainable land management (SLM) provides a ?basket of opportunities? to address these challenges, particularly for increasing land productivity, improving livelihoods, and protecting ecosystems. Within the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) in Tajikistan 70 SLM technologies and approaches on how to implement SLM were documented with the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT ) tools in 2011. For this purpose a climate change adaptation module was developed and tested in order to enhance the understanding about climate change resilience of SLM practices and community workshops conducted to on adaptation mechanisms by rural communities in Tajikistan. The analysis came up with four guiding principles for applying SLM for adapting to climate change: 1. Diversification of land use technologies and farm incomes; 2. Intensification of use of natural resources; 3. Expansion of highly productive land use technologies; 4. Protection of land and livelihoods from extreme weather events. Furthermore, SLM must be up-scaled from isolated plots to entire zones or landscapes and the project developed the concept of three concentric villages zones, the in-, near- and off-village zones. Land users, advisors, and decision- and policy makers face the task of finding management practices that best suit site-specific conditions.

"2611";"Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction during the last millennium using multiple annual proxies";"Feng Shi and Bao Yang and Aur{`e";"Previous studies have either exclusively used annual tree-ring data or have combined tree-ring series with other, lower temporal resolution proxy series. Both approaches can lead to significant uncertainties, as tree-rings may underestimate the amplitude of past temperature variations, and the validity of non-annual records cannot be clearly assessed. In this study, we assembled 45 published Northern Hemisphere (NH) temperature proxy records covering the past millennium, each of which satisfied 3 essential criteria: the series must be of annual resolution, span at least a thousand years, and represent an explicit temperature signal. Suitable climate archives included ice cores, varved lake sediments, tree-rings and speleothems. We reconstructed the average annual land temperature series for the NH over the last millennium by applying 3 different reconstruction techniques: (1) principal components (PC) plus second-order autoregressive model (AR2), (2) composite plus scale (CPS) and (3) regularized errors-in-variables approach (EIV). Our reconstruction is in excellent agreement with 6 climate model simulations (including the first 5 models derived from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and an earth system model of intermediate complexity (LOVECLIM), showing similar temperatures at multi-decadal timescales; however, all simulations appear to underestimate the temperature during the Medieval Warm Period (MWP). A comparison with other NH reconstructions shows that our results are consistent with earlier studies. These results indicate that well-validated annual proxy series should be used to minimize proxy-based artifacts, and that these proxy series contain sufficient information to reconstruct the low-frequency climate variability over the past millennium.";2013;"temperature, proxy, reconstruction, annual, uncertainty"

Remote lakes, defined here as those occurring in high latitude or high altitude regions, have the advantage of not being overprinted by local anthropogenic processes. As such, many of these sites record broad-scale environmental changes, frequently driven by regime shifts in the Earth system. Here, we review a selection of studies from North America and Europe and discuss their broader implications. The history of investigation has evolved synchronously with the scope and awareness of environmental problems. An initial focus on acid deposition switched to metal and other types of pollutants, then climate change and eventually to atmospheric deposition-fertilising effects. However, none of these topics is independent of the other, and all of them affect ecosystem function and biodiversity in profound ways. Currently, remote lake palaeolimnology is developing unique datasets for each region investigated that benchmark current trends with respect to past, purely natural variability in lake systems.

From a conservation perspective, it is important to know whether tropical farmlands can buffer species loss caused by deforestation and how different functional groups of birds respond to land-use intensification. To test the degree of differentiation between farmland and forest bird communities across feeding guilds, we analyzed stable C and N isotopes in blood and claws of 101 bird species comprising four feeding guilds along a tropical forest-farmland gradient in Kenya. We additionally assessed the importance of farmland insectivores for pest control in C4 crops by using allometric relationships, C stable isotope ratios and estimates of bird species abundance. Species composition differed strongly between forest and farmland bird communities. Across seasons, forest birds primarily relied on C3 carbon sources, whereas many farmland birds also assimilated C4 carbon. While C sources of frugivores and omnivores did not differ between forest and farmland communities, insectivores used more C4 carbon in the farmland than in the forest. Granivores assimilated more C4 carbon than all other guilds in the farmland. We estimated that insectivorous farmland birds consumed at least 1,000 kg pest invertebrates km?2 year?1. We conclude that tropical forest and farmland understory bird communities are strongly separated and that tropical farmlands cannot compensate forest loss for insectivorous forest understory birds. In tropical farmlands, insectivorous bird species provide a quantitatively important contribution to pest control.";2013;"tropical, bird, farmland, forest, carbon"

Therefore, hydrological climate impact studies should also integrate scenarios of associated land cover change. To reflect two severe climate-induced changes in land cover, we applied scenarios of glacier retreat and forest cover increase that were derived from the temperature signals of the climate scenarios used in this study. The climate scenarios were derived from ten regional climate models from the ENSEMBLES project. Their respective temperature and precipitation changes between the scenario period (2074?2095) and the control period (1984?2005) were used to run a hydrological model. The relative importance of each of the three types of scenarios (climate, glacier, forest) was assessed through an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Altogether, 15 mountainous catchments in Switzerland were analysed, exhibiting different degrees of glaciation during the control period (0?51%) and different degrees of forest cover increase under scenarios of change (12?55% of the catchment area). The results show that even an extreme change in forest cover is negligible with respect to changes in runoff, but it is crucial as soon as changes in evaporation or soil moisture are concerned. For the latter two variables, the relative impact of forest change is proportional to the magnitude of its change. For changes that concern 35% of the catchment area or more, the effect of forest change on summer evapotranspiration is equally or even more important than the climate signal. For catchments with a glaciation of 10% or more in the control period, the glacier retreat significantly determines summer and annual runoff. The most important source of uncertainty in this study, though, is the climate scenario and it is highly recommended to apply an ensemble of climate scenarios in the impact studies. The results presented here are valid for the climatic region they were tested for, i.e., a humid, mid-latitude mountainous environment. They might be different for regions where the evaporation is a major component of the water balance, for example. Nevertheless, a hydrological climate-impact study that assesses the additional impacts of forest and glacier change is new so far and provides insight into the question whether or not it is necessary to account for land cover changes as part of climate change impacts on hydrological systems.";2013;"land cover change, climate scenarios, glacier retreat, forest cover increase, evaporation"

"2635";"Ecological Studies";"";"An interdisciplinary research unit consisting of 30 teams in the natural, economic and social sciences analyzed biodiversity and ecosystem services of a mountain rainforest ecosystem in the hotspot of the tropical Andes, with special reference to past, current and future environmental changes. The group assessed ecosystem services using data from ecological field and scenario-driven model experiments, and with the help of comparative field surveys of the natural forest and its anthropogenic replacement system for agriculture.  The book offers insights into the impacts of environmental change on various service categories mentioned in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005): cultural, regulating, supporting and provisioning ecosystem services. Examples focus on biodiversity of plants and animals including trophic networks, and abiotic/biotic parameters such as soils, regional climate, water, nutrient and sediment cycles. The types of threats considered include land use and climate changes, as well as atmospheric fertilization. In terms of regulating and provisioning services, the emphasis is primarily on water regulation and supply as well as climate regulation and carbon sequestration. With regard to provisioning services, the synthesis of the book provides science-based recommendations for a sustainable land use portfolio including several options such as forestry, pasture management and the practices of indigenous peoples. In closing, the authors show how they integrated the local society by pursuing capacity building in compliance with the CBD-ABS (Convention on Biological Diversity - Access and Benefit Sharing), in the form of education and knowledge transfer for application.";2013;"interdisciplinary, biodiversity, ecosystem, services, environmental"

Weisser and Wolfgang Wilcke and Helmut Hillebrand";"In the course of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning debate, the issue of multifunctionality of species communities has recently become a major focus. Elemental stoichiometry is related to a variety of processes reflecting multiple plant responses to the biotic and abiotic environment. It can thus be expected that the diversity of a plant assemblage alters community level plant tissue chemistry. We explored elemental stoichiometry in aboveground plant tissue (ratios of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and its relationship to plant diversity in a 5-year study in a large grassland biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment). Species richness and functional group richness affected community stoichiometry, especially by increasing C:P and N:P ratios. The primacy of either species or functional group richness effects depended on the sequence of testing these terms, indicating that both aspects of richness were congruent and complementary to expected strong effects of legume presence and grass presence on plant chemical composition. Legumes and grasses had antagonistic effects on C:N (?27.7% in the presence of legumes, +32.7% in the presence of grasses). In addition to diversity effects on mean ratios, higher species richness consistently decreased the variance of chemical composition for all elemental ratios. The diversity effects on plant stoichiometry has several non-exclusive explanations: The reduction in variance can reflect a statistical averaging effect of species with different chemical composition or a optimization of nutrient uptake at high diversity, leading to converging ratios at high diversity. The shifts in mean ratios potentially reflect higher allocation to stem tissue as plants grew taller at higher richness. By showing a first link between plant diversity and stoichiometry in a multiyear experiment, our results indicate that losing plant species from grassland ecosystems will lead to less reliable chemical composition of forage for herbivorous consumers and belowground litter input.";2013;"biodiversity, multifunctionality, stoichiometry, richness, composition"

In contrast, comparing the strength of biodiversity effects across a large number of ecosystem processes measured in a single experiment permits more direct comparisons. Here, we present an analysis of 418 separate measures of 38 ecosystem processes. Overall, 45 % of processes were significantly affected by plant species richness, suggesting that, while diversity affects a large number of processes not all respond to biodiversity. We therefore compared the strength of plant diversity effects between different categories of ecosystem processes, grouping processes according to the year of measurement, their biogeochemical cycle, trophic level and compartment (above- or belowground) and according to whether they were measures of biodiversity or other ecosystem processes, biotic or abiotic and static or dynamic. Overall, and for several individual processes, we found that biodiversity effects became stronger over time. Measures of the carbon cycle were also affected more strongly by plant species richness than were the measures associated with the nitrogen cycle. Further, we found greater plant species richness effects on measures of biodiversity than on other processes. The differential effects of plant diversity on the various types of ecosystem processes indicate that future research and political effort should shift from a general debate about whether biodiversity loss impairs ecosystem functions to focussing on the specific functions of interest and ways to preserve them individually or in combination.";2013;"prediction, biodiversity, ecosystem, processes, effects"

Soil samples were acquired from Ethiopia?s National Soil Testing Centre and direct field sampling. The reflectance of samples was measured using a FieldSpec 3 diffuse reflectance spectrometer. Outliers and sample relation were evaluated using principal component analysis (PCA) and models were developed through partial least square regression (PLSR). For nine watersheds sampled, 20% of the samples were set aside to test prediction and 80% were used to develop calibration models. Depending on the number of samples per watershed, cross validation or independent validation were used.The stability of models was evaluated using coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and the ratio performance deviation (RPD).

The aim of the Land Matrix partnership is to promote transparency and open data in decisionmaking over land and investment, as a step towards greater accountability. Since its launch, the Land Matrix has attracted a high degree of attention, and stirred some controversy. It provides valuable lessons on the challenges and benefits of promoting open data on practices that are often shrouded in secrecy. This paper critically examines the ongoing efforts by the Land Matrix partnership to build a public tool to promote greater transparency in decision-making over land and investment at a global level. It intends to provoke discussion of the extent to which such a tool can ultimately promote greater transparency and be a step towards greater accountability and improved decision-making. It will present the Land Matrix and its value addition, before detailing the challenges it encountered related to the measurement of the largescale land acquisition phenomenon.

However, up to now the availability of suitable data was limiting the analysis of historical extremes, particularly in remote regions. The new ?Twentieth Century Reanalysis? (20CR), which provides six-hourly, three-dimensional data for the entire globe back to 1871, might provide the means to study this and other early events. While its suitability for studying historical extremes has been analysed for events in the northern extratropics (see other papers in this volume), the representation of tropical cyclones, especially in early times, remains unknown. The aim of this paper is to study to the hurricane that struck Samoa on 15-16 March 1889. We analyse the event in 20CR as well as in contemporary observations. We find that the event is not reproduced in the ensemble mean of 20CR, nor is it within the ensemble spread. We argue that this is due to the paucity of data assimilated into 20CR. A preliminary compilation of historical observations from ships for that period, in contrast, provides a relatively consistent picture of the event. This shows that more observations would be available and implies that future versions of surface-based reanalyses might profit from digitizing further observations in the tropical region.";2013;"weather, extremes, data, cyclone, analysis."

This study develops a concept to quantify entrepreneurship as place-dependent local potential to examine its impact on the local economic performance of rural territories in Switzerland. The short-to-medium-term impact of entrepreneurship on the economic performance of 1706 rural municipalities in Switzerland is assessed by applying three spatial random effects models. Results suggest a generally positive relationship between entrepreneurship and local development: rural municipalities with higher entrepreneurial potential generally show higher business tax revenues per capita and a lower share of social welfare cases among the population, although the impact on local employment is less clear. The explanatory power of entrepreneurship in all three models, however, was only moderate. This finding suggests that political expectations of fostering entrepreneurship to boost endogenous rural development in the short-to-medium term should be damped.";2013;"development, entrepreneurship, rural, local, potential"

The framework is a thinking tool meant as a heuristic that outlines key factors and different dimensions that need to be addressed when assessing vulnerability in the context of natural hazards and climate change. The approach underlines that the key factors of such a common framework are related to the exposure of a society or system to a hazard or stressor, the susceptibility of the system or community exposed, and its resilience and adaptive capacity. Additionally, it underlines the necessity to consider key factors and multiple thematic dimensions when assessing vulnerability in the context of natural and socio-natural hazards. In this regard, it shows key linkages between the different concepts used within the disaster risk management (DRM) and climate change adaptation (CCA) research. Further, it helps to illustrate the strong relationships between different concepts used in DRM and CCA. The framework is also a tool for communicating complexity and stresses the need for societal change in order to reduce risk and to promote adaptation. With regard to this, the policy relevance of the framework and first results of its application are outlined. Overall, the framework presented enhances the discussion on how to frame and link vulnerability, disaster risk, risk management and adaptation concepts.";2013;"development, framework, vulnerability, risk, adaptation"

Villagers from two communities in the Tunari Mountain Range were asked to list, describe, map and categorize the places they knew on their community?s territory. Results show that place names capture spatially explicit units which integrate biotic and abiotic nature and humans, and that there is an emphasis on topographic terms, highlighting the importance of geodiversity. Farmers? perspectives differ from the classical view of ecosystems because they ?humanize? places, considering them as living beings with agency. Consequently, they do not make a distinction between natural and cultural heritage. Their perspective of the environment is that of a personalized, dynamic relationship with the elements of the natural world that are perceived as living entities. A practical implication of the findings for sustainable development is that since places names make the links between people and the elements of the landscape, toponymy is a tool for ecosystem management rooted in indigenous knowledge. Because place names refer to holistic units linked with people?s experience and spatially explicit, they can be used as an entry point to implement an intercultural dialogue for more sustainable land management.";2013;"ecosystem, indigenous, place names, geodiversity, intercultural"
"2661";"Perception and Interpretation of Climate Change among Quechua Farmers of Bolivia: Indigenous Knowledge as a Resource for Adaptive Capacity";"S{'e";"We aim to explore how indigenous peoples observe and ascribe meaning to change. The case study involves two Quechua-speaking farmer communities from mountainous areas near Cochabamba, Bolivia. Taking climate change as a starting point, we found that, first, farmers often associate their observations of climate change with other social and environmental changes, such as value change in the community, population growth, out-migration, urbanization, and land degradation. Second, some of the people interpret change as part of a cycle, which includes a belief in the return of some characteristics of ancient or mythological times. Third, environmental change is also perceived as the expression of ?extra-human intentionalities,? a reaction of natural or spiritual entities that people consider living beings. On the basis of these interpretations of change and their adaptive strategies, we discuss the importance of indigenous knowledge as a component of adaptive capacity. Even in the context of living with modern science and mass media, indigenous patterns of interpreting phenomena tend to be persistent. Our results support the view that indigenous knowledge must be acknowledged as process, emphasizing ways of observing, discussing, and interpreting new information. In this case, indigenous knowledge can help address complex relationships between phenomena, and help design adaptation strategies based on experimentation and knowledge coproduction.";2013;"indigenous, change, observation, interpretation, adaptation"

However, lack of clarity in land governance and carbon rights could undermine REDD+ implementation. Strategies are needed to avoid perverse incentives resulting from the commoditization of forest carbon stocks and, importantly, to identify and secure the rights of legitimate recipients of future REDD+ payments. We propose a landscape-level approach to address potential conflicts related to carbon tenure and REDD+ benefit sharing. We explore various land-tenure scenarios and their implications for carbon ownership in the context of a research site in northern Laos. Our case study shows that a combination of relevant scientific tools, knowledge, and participatory approaches can help avoid the marginalization of rural communities during the REDD+ process.

However, their correlation with seasonal or annual mean temperature and precipitation at nearby sites is often low. This is partly due to the irregular sampling of the atmosphere by the ice core (i.e. ice cores almost only record precipitation events and not dry periods) and the possible incongruity between annual layers and calendar years. Using daily meteorological data from a nearby station and reanalyses, we replicate the ice core from the Grenzgletscher (Switzerland, 4200m a.s.l.) on a sample-by-sample basis by calculating precipitation-weighted temperature (PWT) over short intervals. Over the last 15 yr of the ice core record, accumulation and delta O-18 variations can be well reproduced on a sub-seasonal scale. This allows a wiggle-matching approach for defining quasi-annual layers, resulting in high correlations between measured quasi-annual delta O-18 and PWT. Further back in time, the agreement deteriorates. Nevertheless, we find significant correlations over the entire length of the record (1938-1993) of ice core delta O-18 with PWT, but not with annual mean temperature. This is due to the low correlations between PWT and annual mean temperature, a characteristic which in ERA-Interim reanalysis is also found for many other continental mid-to-high-latitude regions. The fact that meteorologically very different years can lead to similar combinations of PWT and accumulation poses limitations to the use of delta O-18 from Alpine ice cores for temperature reconstructions. Rather than for reconstructing annual mean temperature, delta O-18 from Alpine ice cores should be used to reconstruct PWT over quasi-annual periods. This variable is reproducible in reanalysis or climate model data and could thus be assimilated into conventional climate models.";2013;"temperature, precipitation, ice core, delta O-18, accumulation"

In 2011, the ?Twentieth Century Reanalysis? (20CR) was released, a 6-hourly global atmospheric data set covering the past 140 years, thus combining the two properties. The collection of short papers in this volume contains case studies of individual extreme events in the 20CR data set. In this overview paper we introduce the first six cases and summarise some common findings. All of the events are represented in 20CR in a physically consistent way, allowing further meteorological interpretations and process studies. Also, for most of the events, the magnitudes are underestimated in the ensemble mean. Possible causes are addressed. For interpreting extrema it may be necessary to address individual ensemble members. Also, the density of observations underlying 20CR should be considered.

"2672";"Aerological observations in the Tropics in the Early Twentieth Century";"Stefan Br{\"o";"In the first decades of the 20th century, aerological observations were for the first time performed in tropical regions. One of the most prominent endeavours in this respect was ARTHUR BERSON?s aerological expedition to East Africa. Although the main target was the East African monsoon circulation, the expedition provided also other insights that profoundly changed meteorology and climatology. BERSON observed that the tropical tropopause was much higher and colder than that over midlatitudes. Moreover, westerly winds were observed in the lower stratosphere, apparently contradicting the high-altitude equatorial easterly winds that were known since the Krakatoa eruption (??Krakatoa easterlies??). The puzzle was only resolved five decades later with the discovery of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). In this paper we briefly summarize the expedition of BERSON and review the results in a historical context and in the light of the current research. In the second part of the paper we re-visit BERSON?s early aerological observations, which we have digitized. We compare the observed wind profiles with corresponding profiles extracted from the ??Twentieth Century Reanalysis??, which provides global three-dimensional weather information back to 1871 based on an assimilation of sea-level and surface pressure data. The comparison shows a good agreement at the coast but less good agreement further inland, at the shore of Lake Victoria, where the circulation is more complex. These results demonstrate that BERSON?s observations are still valuable today as input to current reanalysis systems or for their validation.";2013;"aerological, expedition, tropical, circulation, wind"

Previous studies have addressed the role of atmospheric circulation in this period based on geopotential height fields because observations of upper-level winds in the Arctic are rare. Here we analyse winds over the Arctic and specifically over Spitsbergen in the ?Twentieth Century Reanalyses? (20CR). We compare in situ upper-air wind measurements performed in 1912 and 1913 in Spitsbergen with six-hourly 20CR data. Furthermore, we compare monthly-to-seasonal 20CR winds at 700 hPa over the European Arctic with statistically reconstructed winds at 3 km altitude. Finally, we analyse long-term trends in Arctic winds in 20CR. The general agreement between observed upper-air winds and 20CR on the day-to-day scale is rather poor, which is not surprising given the paucity of observations in the Arctic at that time that constrain 20CR. In contrast, the seasonally averaged winds (which represent a larger spatial scale) in 20CR compare well with statistically reconstructed winds. The analysis of long term near-surface wind time series in 20CR shows arguably artificial trends from 1871 to around the 1950s over sparsely observed regions, particularly oceanic regions. Densely observed regions such as Europe or the USA show no such trends. This analysis shows that great care needs to be taken when working with 20CR in the Arctic and other sparsely observed regions.";2013;"climat, arctic, winds, data, trends"

Historical changes in land cover and land use were analyzed using a chronological series of remote sensing data. Impacts of landscape change on local livelihoods were investigated in seven villages through interviews with various stakeholders. The study reveals that the complex mosaics of agriculture and forest patches observed in the study area have long constituted key assets for the resilience of local livelihood systems in the face of environmental and socio-economic risks. However, over the past 20 years, a process of segregating agricultural and forest spaces has increased the vulnerability of local land users. This process is a direct outcome of policies aimed at increasing national forest cover, eradicating shifting cultivation and fostering the emergence of more intensive and commercial agricultural practices. We argue that agriculture-forest segregation should be buffered in such a way that a diversity of livelihood opportunities and economic development pathways can be maintained.";2013;"landscape, change, livelihoods, agriculture-forest, segregation"

Few quantitative high-resolution reconstructions exist for South America which is the only land mass extending from the tropics to the southern high latitudes at 56?S. We analyzed sediment cores from two adjacent lakes in Northern Chilean Patagonia, Lago Castor (45?36?S, 71?47?W) and Laguna Escondida (45?31?S, 71?49?W). Radiometric dating (210Pb, 137Cs, 14C-AMS) suggests that the cores reach back to c. 900 BC (Laguna Escondida) and c. 1900 BC (Lago Castor). Both lakes show similarities and reproducibility in sedimentation rate changes and tephra layer deposition. We found eight macroscopic tephras (0.2?5.5 cm thick) dated at 1950 BC, 1700 BC, at 300 BC, 50 BC, 90 AD, 160 AD, 400 AD and at 900 AD. These can be used as regional time-synchronous stratigraphic markers. The two thickest tephras represent known well-dated explosive eruptions of Hudson volcano around 1950 and 300 BC. Biogenic silica flux revealed in both lakes a climate signal and correlation with annual temperature reanalysis data (calibration 1900?2006 AD; Lago Castor r = 0.37; Laguna Escondida r = 0.42, seven years filtered data). We used a linear inverse regression plus scaling model for calibration and leave-one-out cross-validation (RMSEv = 0.56 ?C) to reconstruct sub decadal-scale temperature variability for Laguna Escondida back to AD 400. The lower part of the core from Laguna Escondida prior to AD 400 and the core of Lago Castor are strongly influenced by primary and secondary tephras and, therefore, not used for the temperature reconstruction. The temperature reconstruction from Laguna Escondida shows cold conditions in the 5th century (relative to the 20th century mean), warmer temperatures from AD 600 to AD 1150 and colder temperatures from AD 1200 to AD 1450. From AD 1450 to AD 1700 our reconstruction shows a period with stronger variability and on average higher values than the 20th century mean. Until AD 1900 the temperature values decrease but stay slightly above the 20th century mean. Most of the centennial-scale features are reproduced in the few other natural climate archives in the region. The early onset of cool conditions from c. AD 1200 onward seems to be confirmed for this region.";2013;"climate, reconstructions, lakes, chilean, temperature"

But this is a crude approach that risks missing a large share of the poor. This issue of evidence for policy shows how careful analysis of detailed spatial information ? in this case in Laos ? can reveal patterns that are not immediately obvious.

Using the results of an open-ended survey conducted in southeast Australia, we examine how a set of preparedness messages is interpreted. The paper demonstrates that the concept of wildfire preparedness is ambiguous, and that being ?well prepared? is a complex mix of practical and mental preparedness measures. Many of the individual interpretations of preparedness messages are found to not align with the official outlined intent. In particular, we argue that the lack of a clear definition and engagement with ?mental preparedness? in wildfire risk communication has resulted in an inability to clearly relate to, and articulate what it means to be both physically and mentally prepared for wildfire. The survey illustrates how even well-trained wildfire management professionals and volunteers misinterpret relatively uncontested risk messages, and we describe how these misinterpretations might result in dangerous decisions if wildfire threat is realised. The work also reveals three key themes that define different aspects of mental preparedness: emotional control, understanding psychological strain, and the ability to know when and how to implement a wildfire plan. The paper concludes that wildfire risk communication efforts can be improved through heightened attention to the disseminators? as well as the recipients? understanding, explanation and adoption of risk information.";2013;"gap, preparedness, interpretation, ambiguity, communication"

Fern{'a";"Understanding natural climate variability and its driving factors is crucial to assessing future climate change. Therefore, comparing proxy-based climate reconstructions with forcing factors as well as comparing these with paleoclimate model simulations is key to gaining insights into the relative roles of internal versus forced variability. A review of the state of modelling of the climate of the last millennium prior to the CMIP5?PMIP3 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5?Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 3) coordinated effort is presented and compared to the available temperature reconstructions. Simulations and reconstructions broadly agree on reproducing the major temperature changes and suggest an overall linear response to external forcing on multidecadal or longer timescales. Internal variability is found to have an important influence at hemispheric and global scales. The spatial distribution of simulated temperature changes during the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly to the Little Ice Age disagrees with that found in the reconstructions. Thus, either internal variability is a possible major player in shaping temperature changes through the millennium or the model simulations have problems realistically representing the response pattern to external forcing. A last millennium transient climate response (LMTCR) is defined to provide a quantitative framework for analysing the consistency between simulated and reconstructed climate. Beyond an overall agreement between simulated and reconstructed LMTCR ranges, this analysis is able to single out specific discrepancies between some reconstructions and the ensemble of simulations. The disagreement is found in the cases where the reconstructions show reduced covariability with external forcings or when they present high rates of temperature change.";2013;"climate, variability, forcing, simulations, reconstructions"

We find that 20CR reproduces the circulation pattern as well as the temperature development very well. Regarding the absolute values of variables such as snow fall or minimum and maximum surface pressure, there is anunderestimation of the observed extremes, which may be due to the low spatial resolution of 20CR and the fact that only the ensemble mean is considered.

State-of-the-art palaeoclimatic methods routinely use hydroclimatic proxies to reconstruct temperature (for example, refs 3, 4), possibly blurring differences in the variability continuum of temperature and precipitation before the instrumental period. Here, we assess the spectral characteristics of temperature and precipitation fluctuations in observations, model simulations and proxy records across the globe. We find that whereas an ensemble of different general circulation models represents patterns captured in instrumental measurements, such as land?ocean contrasts and enhanced low-frequency tropical variability, the tree-ring-dominated proxy collection does not. The observed dominance of inter-annual precipitation fluctuations is not reflected in the annually resolved hydroclimatic proxy records. Likewise, temperature-sensitive proxies overestimate, on average, the ratio of low- to high-frequency variability. These spectral biases in the proxy records seem to propagate into multi-proxy climate reconstructions for which we observe an overestimation of low-frequency signals. Thus, a proper representation of the high- to low-frequency spectrum in proxy records is needed to reduce uncertainties in climate reconstruction efforts.";2013;"external, internal, variability, proxy, spectrum"

Potential enhanced flood occurrence due to global climate change would thus increase threat to settlements, infrastructure, and human lives in the affected regions. Yet, projections of intense precipitation exhibit major uncertainties and robust reconstructions of Alpine floods are limited to the instrumental and historical period. Here we present a 2500-year long flood reconstruction for the European Alps, based on dated sedimentary flood deposits from ten lakes in Switzerland. We show that periods with high flood frequency coincide with cool summer temperatures. This wet-cold synchronism suggests enhanced flood occurrence to be triggered by latitudinal shifts of Atlantic and Mediterranean storm tracks. This paleoclimatic perspective reveals natural analogues for varying climate conditions, and thus can contribute to a better understanding and improved projections of weather extremes under climate change.";2013;"floods, alpine, precipitation, reconstruction, climate"

While the pasture grass was co-limited by N and P, most tree species responded to P addition.

Little information is available on the basic socio-economic situation and respective possible patterns in shifting cultivation landscapes on a regional level. On the basis of a recent approximation of the extent of shifting cultivation landscapes for two time periods and disaggregated village level census data, this paper characterizes these landscapes in terms of key socioeconomic parameters for the whole of northern Laos. Results showed that over 550,000 people live in shifting cultivation regions. The poverty rate of this population of 46.5 % is considerably higher than the national rural rate. Most shifting cultivation landscapes are located in remote locations and a high share of the population comprises ethnic minorities, pointing to multi-dimensional marginality of these areas.

Making ecosystem services count!";"Cornelia Hett and Julie Gwendolin Z{\"a";"Mapping ecosystem services (ES) and their trade-offs is a key requirement for informed decision making for land use planning and management of natural resources that aim to move towards increasing the sustainability of landscapes. The negotiations of the purposes of landscapes and the services they should provide are difficult as there is an increasing number of stakeholders active at different levels with a variety of interests present on one particular landscape.Traditionally, land cover data is at the basis for mapping and spatial monitoring of ecosystem services. In light of complex landscapes it is however questionable whether land cover per se and as a spatial base unit is suitable for monitoring and management at the meso-scale. Often the characteristics of a landscape are defined by prevalence, composition and specific spatial and temporal patterns of different land cover types. The spatial delineation of shifting cultivation agriculture represents a prominent example of a land use system with its different land use intensities that requires alternative methodologies that go beyond the common remote sensing approaches of pixel-based land cover analysis due to the spatial and temporal dynamics of rotating cultivated and fallow fields.Against this background we advocate that adopting a landscape perspective to spatial planning and decision making offers new space for negotiation and collaboration, taking into account the needs of local resource users, and of the global community. For this purpose we introduce landscape mosaicsdefined as new spatial unit describing generalized land use types. Landscape mosaics have allowed us to chart different land use systems and land use intensities and permitted us to delineate changes in these land use systems based on changes of external claims on these landscapes. The underlying idea behindthe landscape mosaics is to use land cover data typically derived from remote sensing data and to analyse and classify spatial patterns of this land cover data using a moving window approach. We developed the landscape mosaics approach in tropical, forest dominated landscapesparticularly shifting cultivation areas and present examples ofour work from northern Laos, eastern Madagascarand Yunnan Province in China.";2013;"ecosystem services, trade-offs, landscapes, land cover, mosaics"

With respect to the SPI6 index, the agreement between 20CR and station data is good except again for 1947 (conversely, drought was overestimated in 20CR for 1945 and 1949). Low SPI values in 20CR are accompanied by negative soil moisture anomalies and a negative water balance.

Rudaz and Markus Zimmermann";"The development of susceptibility maps for debris flows is of primary importance due to population pressure in hazardous zones. However, hazard assessment by process-based modelling at a regional scale is difficult due to the complex nature of the phenomenon, the variability of local controlling factors, and the uncertainty in modelling parameters. A regional assessment must consider a simplified approach that is not highly parameter dependant and that can provide zonation with minimum data requirements. A distributed empirical model has thus been developed for regional susceptibility assessments using essentially a digital elevation model (DEM). The model is called Flow-R for Flow path assessment of gravitational hazards at a Regional scale (available free of charge under http://www.flow-r.org) and has been successfully applied to different case studies in various countries with variable data quality. It provides a substantial basis for a preliminary susceptibility assessment at a regional scale. The model was also found relevant to assess other natural hazards such as rockfall, snow avalanches and floods.  The model allows for automatic source area delineation, given user criteria, and for the assessment of the propagation extent based on various spreading algorithms and simple frictional laws. We developed a new spreading algorithm, an improved version of Holmgren's direction algorithm, that is less sensitive to small variations of the DEM and that is avoiding over-channelization, and so produces more realistic extents.  The choices of the datasets and the algorithms are open to the user, which makes it compliant for various applications and dataset availability. Amongst the possible datasets, the DEM is the only one that is really needed for both the source area delineation and the propagation assessment; its quality is of major importance for the results accuracy. We consider a 10 m DEM resolution as a good compromise between processing time and quality of results. However, valuable results have still been obtained on the basis of lower quality DEMs with 25 m resolution.";2013;"development, susceptibility maps, regional scale, hazard assessment, digital elevation model"

Consequently, there is a lack of spatial data on the dynamics of shifting cultivation landscapes on a regional, i.e. sub-national, or national level. We present an approach based on a time series of Landsat and MODIS data and landscape metrics to delineate the dynamics of shifting cultivation landscapes. Our results reveal that shifting cultivation is a land use system still widely and dynamically utilized in northern Laos. While there is an overall reduction in the areas dominated by shifting cultivation, some regions also show an expansion. A review of relevant reports and articles indicates that policies tend to lead to a reduction while market forces can result in both expansion and reduction. For a better understanding of the different factors affecting shifting cultivation landscapes in Laos, further research should focus on spatially explicit analyses.";2013;"dynamic, remote, detection, spatial, factors"

This paper thus explores how buffer capacity, a characteristic feature of resilience, can be conceptualised and used for assessing the resilience of smallholder agriculture to climate change. It uses the case of conservation agriculture farmers in a Kenyan region and examines how their practices contribute to buffer capacity. Surveys were used to collect data from 41 purposely selected conservation agriculture farmers in the Laikipia region of Kenya. Besides descriptive statistics, factor analysis was used to identify the key dimensions that characterise buffer capacity in the study context. The cluster of practices characterising buffer capacity in conservation agriculture include soil protection, adapted crops, intensification/irrigation, mechanisation and livelihood diversification. Various conservation practices increase buffer capacity, evaluated by farmers in economic, social, ecological and other dimensions. Through conservation agriculture, most farmers improved their productivity and incomes despite drought, improved their environment and social relations. Better-off farmers also reduced their need for labour, but this resulted in lesser income-earning opportunities for the poorer farmers, thus reducing the buffer capacity and resilience of the latter.";2013;"resilience, buffer, agriculture, conservation, capacity"

For this purpose, 108 buffalo cows and 27 bulls were randomly selected. Mean, standard error, Student's t test and Chi-square test were used for various comparisons. The results show that the majority of animals have a brown coat colour. Cows have significantly higher heart girths, longer horns, longer necks and wider faces at the level of the eyes than bulls, whereas bulls have significantly longer bodies, longer ears, thicker horns, thicker necks and larger hooves than cows. Horns are flat laterally, directed backwards and then slightly upwards without twisting, leading to a sickle to semi-sickle appearance. Owing to its small body size and brown coat colour, the breed is well adapted to mountain slope grazing and thrives well away from swamps.

Based on the premise that Sustainable Land Management (SLM) experiences are not sufficiently or comprehensively documented, evaluated, and shared, the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) initiative (www.wocat.net), in collaboration with FAO?s Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands (LADA) project (www.fao.org/nr/lada/) and the EU?s DESIRE project (http://www.desire-project.eu/), has developed standardised tools and methods for compiling and evaluating the biophysical and socio-economic knowledge available about SLM. The tools allow SLM specialists to share their knowledge and assess the impact of SLM at the local, national, and global levels. As a whole, the WOCAT?LADA?DESIRE methodology comprises tools for documenting, self-evaluating, and assessing the impact of SLM practices, as well as for knowledge sharing and decision support in the field, at the planning level, and in scaling up identified good practices. SLM depends on flexibility and responsiveness to changing complex ecological and socioeconomic causes of land degradation. The WOCAT tools are designed to reflect and capture this capacity of SLM. In order to take account of new challenges and meet emerging needs of WOCAT users, the tools are constantly further developed and adapted. Recent enhancements include tools for improved data analysis (impact and cost/benefit), cross-scale mapping, climate change adaptation and disaster risk management, and easier reporting on SLM best practices to UNCCD and other national and international partners. Moreover, WOCAT has begun to give land users a voice by backing conventional documentation with video clips straight from the field. To promote the scaling up of SLM, WOCAT works with key institutions and partners at the local and national level, for example advisory services and implementation projects.

"2756";"2nd UNCCD Scientific Conference";"Hans Peter Liniger and Godert Van Lynden and Riccardo Biancalani and Lehman Lindeque and D{'e";"Global investment in Sustainable Land Management (SLM) has been substantial, but knowledge gaps remain. Overviews of where land degradation (LD) is taking place and how land users are addressing the problem using SLM are still lacking for most individual countries and regions. Relevant maps focus more on LD than SLM, and they have been compiled using different methods. This makes it impossible to compare the benefits of SLM interventions and prevents informed decision-making on how best to invest in land. To fill this knowledge gap, a standardised mapping method has been collaboratively developed by the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT), FAO?s Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands (LADA) project, and the EU?s Mitigating Desertification and Remediating Degraded Land (DESIRE) project. The method generates information on the distribution and characteristics of LD and SLM activities and can be applied at the village, national, or regional level. It is based on participatory expert assessment, documents, and surveys. These data sources are spatially displayed across a land-use systems base map. By enabling mapping of the DPSIR framework (Driving Forces-Pressures-State-Impacts-Responses) for degradation and conservation, the method provides key information for decision-making. It may also be used to monitor LD and conservation following project implementation. This contribution explains the mapping method, highlighting findings made at different levels (national and local) in South Africa and the Mediterranean region.

Switzerland is a highly urbanized country where small and medium-sized urban centers play an important role in ensuring a balanced national urban system. Besides the four largest metropolitan regions ?Zurich, Geneva, Basel and Bern?, small and medium-sized towns function as central places for a wider, often extensive hinterland. They provide opportunities for living and working and they connect rural and mountain regions to national and international networks. Using secondary statistics and a case study, the paper shows that small and medium-sized urban centers are home to significant concentrations of export-oriented industries. Firms in these value-adding secondary sectors are rooted in these places and benefit from strong local embeddedness while also being oriented towards global markets. Small and medium-sized urban centers also profit from their strong local identities. While these places face various challenges, they function as important pillars in creating a balanced regional development pattern. Swiss regional development policy follows the goal of polycentric spatial development and it employs various instruments that aim to ensure a balanced urban system.";2013;"urban, switzerland, centers, small, medium-sized"

Moore and Olivia Romppainen-Martius";"Tropical cyclogenesis is generally considered to occur in regions devoid of baroclinic structures; however, an appreciable number of tropical cyclones (TCs) form in baroclinic environments each year. A global climatology of these baroclinically influenced TC developments is presented in this study. An objective classification strategy is developed that focuses on the characteristics of the environmental state rather than on properties of the vortex, thus allowing for a pointwise ?development pathway? classification of reanalysis data. The resulting climatology shows that variability within basins arises primarily as a result of local surface thermal contrasts and the positions of time-mean features on the subtropical tropopause. The pathway analyses are sampled to generate a global climatology of 1948?2010 TC developments classified by baroclinic influence: nonbaroclinic (70%), low-level baroclinic (9%), trough induced (5%), weak tropical transition (11%), and strong tropical transition (5%). All basins other than the North Atlantic are dominated by nonbaroclinic events; however, there is extensive interbasin variability in secondary development pathways. Within each basin, subregions and time periods are identified in which the relative importance of the development pathways also differs. The efficiency of tropical cyclogenesis is found to be highly dependent on development pathway. The peak efficiency defined in the classification subspace straddles the nonbaroclinic/trough-induced boundary, suggesting that the optimal environment for TC development includes a baroclinic contribution from an upper-level disturbance. By assessing the global distribution of baroclinically influenced TC formations, this study identifies regions and pathways whose further study could yield improvements in our understanding of this important subset of TC developments.";2013;"baroclinic, global, climatology, tropical, cyclones"

Similarly, farmers groups and primary societies are now allowed to sell coffee at auction. Thus, farmers have various options for selling their coffee. Similarly, the coffee industry has experienced large fluctuations in prices and stagnation in production. How do farmers react to these changes? Can and do farmers profit from different market conditions and sell to different traders at the lower end of the value chain, or do they remain with cooperatives or farmers groups? This study was conducted in Mruwia and Mshiri villages in Moshi Rural district. Whereas Mshiri village remains attached to the Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union (KNCU), Mruwia has detached from this organization and sells coffee independently. The sample (103) was randomly selected from the coffee farmers in the two villages. Data were collected through surveys, focus group discussions (FGDs), and socio-anthropological methods (participant-observation, biographies, and thematic interviews). Results indicate that the selection of whom to sell coffee depends largely on farmers? dependence on coffee and prices, other benefits accrued, and whether the initial costs are covered by buyers. Additionally, most respondents did not sell coffee to PCBs. Thus, prices, the institutional infrastructure, and the structure of local communities were important when making decisions about how and with whom to trade.";2013;"market liberalization, tanzania, farmers, coffee, cooperatives"

Ngana";"Watershed services are the benefits people obtain from the flow of water through a watershed. While demand for such services is increasing in most parts of the world, supply is getting more insecure due to human impacts on ecosystems such as climate or land use change. Population and water management authorities therefore require information on the potential availability of watershed services in the future and the trade-offs involved.  In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to model watershed service availability for future management and climate change scenarios in the East African Pangani Basin. In order to quantify actual ?benefits?, SWAT2005 was slightly modified, calibrated and configured at the required spatial and temporal resolution so that simulated water resources and processes could be characterized based on their valuation by stakeholders and their accessibility. The calibrated model was then used to evaluate three management and three climate scenarios.  The results show that by the year 2025, not primarily the physical availability of water, but access to water resources and efficiency of use represent the greatest challenges. Water to cover basic human needs is available at least 95% of time but must be made accessible to the population through investments in distribution infrastructure. Concerning the trade-off between agricultural use and hydropower production, there is virtually no potential for an increase in hydropower even if it is given priority. Agriculture will necessarily expand spatially as a result of population growth, and can even benefit from higher irrigation water availability per area unit, given improved irrigation efficiency and enforced regulation to ensure equitable distribution of available water. The decline in services from natural terrestrial ecosystems (e.g. charcoal, food), due to the expansion of agriculture, increases the vulnerability of residents who depend on such services mostly in times of drought. The expected impacts of climate change may contribute to an increase or decrease in watershed service availability, but are only marginal and much lower than management impacts up to the year 2025.";2013;"watershed, services, future, management, climate"

Residents who wish to evacuate prior to the arrival of a wildfire also need to prepare their property and themselves for such an action. Despite the importance of preparation, there are no clear and quantifiable definitions of what it means to be prepared for different exposures to wildfire. Here we develop a model and definitions of what it means to be prepared for wildfire. The model considers the exposure of the property, the ability of the structure to withstand such an exposure and whether the resident(s) are adequately prepared. Preparation considers the physical and mental capacity of the residents, the condition of the grounds and the equipment available to defend the property. The model and definitions presented here focus on identifying points of weakness that should be addressed. An improved model and definitions will provide a benchmark for those residents who do prepare for wildfire, potentially reducing the risk of loss of property and life. However they are unlikely to address the large proportion of the at risk population that elect not to prepare for wildfire.";2013;"wildfire, preparedness, model, exposure, residents"

Ethiopia was among the first sub-Saharan countries to devise a biofuel policy strategy to guide the associated demand toward sustainable development. In this paper, I discuss Ethiopia?s biofuel policy from an interpretative research position using a frames approach and argue that useful insights can be obtained by paying more attention to national contexts and values represented in the debates on whether biofuel production can or will contribute to sustainable development. To this end, I was able to distinguish three major frames used in the Ethiopian debate on biofuels: an environmental rehabilitation frame, a green revolution frame and a legitimacy frame. The article concludes that actors advocating for frames related to social and human issues have difficulties entering the debate and forming alliances, and that those voices need to be included in order for Ethiopia to develop a sustainable biofuel sector.";2013;"biofuel, policy, ethiopia, frames, sustainable"

Although several approaches have been developed over the last decade, some of them are difficult to apply in practice, mainly because of the lack of valuable data on historical damages or on damage functions. In this paper, two possible consequence indicators based on a combination of descriptors of the exposure of the elements at risk are proposed in order to map the potential impacts of landslides and highlight the most vulnerable areas. The first index maps the physical vulnerability due to landslide; the second index maps both direct damage (physical, structural, functional) and indirect damage (socio-economic impacts) of landslide hazards.

"2791";"5th Symposium for Research in Protected Areas";"Ronald E. P{\"o";"In terms of changing flow and sediment regimes of rivers, dams are often regarded as the most dominant form of human impact on fluvial systems. Dams can decrease the flux of water and sediments leading to channel changes such as upstream aggradation and downstream degradation. The opposite effects occur when dams are removed. Channel degradation often requires further intervention in terms of river bed and bank protection works. The situation evolves more complex in river systems that are impacted by a series of dams due to feedback processes between the different system compartments. A number of studies have recently investigated geomorphic systems using connectivity approaches to improve the understanding of geomorphic system response to change. This paper presents a case study  investigating the impact of dam construction, dam removal and dam-related river bed and bank protection measures on the sediment connectivity and channel morphology of the Fugnitz and the Kaja  Rivers using a combination of DEM analyses, field surveys and landscape evolution modelling. For both river systems the results revealed low sediment connectivity accompanied by a fine river bed sediment facies in river sections upstream of active dams and of removed dams with protection measures. Contrarily, high sediment connectivity which was accompanied by a coarse river bed sediment facies was observed in river sections either located downstream of active dams or of removed dams with upstream protection. In terms of channel changes, significant channel degradation was examined at locations downstream of active dams and of removed dams. Channel bed and bank protection measures prevent erosion and channel slope recovery after dam removal. Landscape evolution modeling revealed a complex geomorphic response to dam construction and dam removal as sediment output rates and therefore geomorphic processes have been shown to act in a non-linear  manner. These insights are deemed to have major implications for river management and conservation, as quality and state of riverine habitats are determined by channel morphology and river bed sediment composition.";2013;"dams, sediment, channel, connectivity, geomorphic"

Cuny and Annie Deslauriers and Patrick Fonti and David Frank and Jo{v z";"Background and Aims  Ongoing global warming has been implicated in shifting phenological patterns such as the timing and duration of the growing season across a wide variety of ecosystems. Linear models are routinely used to extrapolate these observed shifts in phenology into the future and to estimate changes in associated ecosystem properties such as net primary productivity. Yet, in nature, linear relationships may be special cases. Biological processes frequently follow more complex, non-linear patterns according to limiting factors that generate shifts and discontinuities, or contain thresholds beyond which responses change abruptly. This study investigates to what extent cambium phenology is associated with xylem growth and differentiation across conifer species of the northern hemisphere.   Methods  Xylem cell production is compared with the periods of cambial activity and cell differentiation assessed on a weekly time scale on histological sections of cambium and wood tissue collected from the stems of nine species in Canada and Europe over 1?9 years per site from 1998 to 2011.   Key Results  The dynamics of xylogenesis were surprisingly homogeneous among conifer species, although dispersions from the average were obviously observed. Within the range analysed, the relationships between the phenological timings were linear, with several slopes showing values close to or not statistically different from 1. The relationships between the phenological timings and cell production were distinctly non-linear, and involved an exponential pattern.    Conclusions  The trees adjust their phenological timings according to linear patterns. Thus, shifts of one phenological phase are associated with synchronous and comparable shifts of the successive phases. However, small increases in the duration of xylogenesis could correspond to a substantial increase in cell production. The findings suggest that the length of the growing season and the resulting amount of growth could respond differently to changes in environmental conditions.";2013;"global warming, phenology, xylem, conifer, non-linear"

To our knowledge this is the first comparative studies reaching back to the end of the ?Little Ice Age? and comprising an almost entire regional flora covering the complete range of habitats. During the recent survey, most species were found at higher elevations. Even though the differences fit well with the expected shifts due to climate warming we cannot exclude effects of sampling bias. However, we assume that the relative differences between species groups can be safely interpreted. The differences in upper limits between both surveys were significantly larger among forest species. The most important reason is probably discontinued pasture and mowing, which may have amplified possible warming effects. Nitrogen deposits may have contributed to this effect by placing competitive species in a more advantageous position.";2013;"differences, historical, upper, limits, species"

Consequently, regional development has to face aggravation of existing or emergence of new conflicts of interest. In this context, transdisciplinary co-production of knowledge is considered as an important means for coping with these challenges. Accordingly, the MontanAqua project aims at developing strategies for more sustainable water management in the study area Crans-Montana-Sierre (Switzerland) in a transdisciplinary way. It strives for co-producing system, target and transformation knowledge among researchers, policy makers, public administration and civil society organizations. The research process basically consisted of the following steps: First, the current water situation in the study region was investigated. How much water is available? How much water is being used? How are decisions on water distribution and use taken? Second, participatory scenario workshops were conducted in order to identify the stakeholders? visions of regional development. Third, the water situation in 2050 was simulated by modeling the evolution of water resources and water use and by reflecting on the institutional aspects. These steps laid ground for jointly assessing the consequences of the stakeholders? visions of development in view of scientific data regarding governance, availability and use of water in the region as well as developing necessary transformation knowledge. During all of these steps researchers have collaborated with stakeholders in the support group RegiEau. The RegiEau group consists of key representatives of owners, managers, users, and pressure groups related to water and landscape: representatives of the communes (mostly the presidents), the canton (administration and parliament), water management associations, agriculture, viticulture, hydropower, tourism, and landscape protection.

Different degrees and amounts of lignification in plants and their imprecise description, together with a conceptually doubtful life form catalog including trees, shrubs and herbs further complicate our understanding of ?wood?. Here, we use permanent micro sections to demonstrate that the xylem and bark of terrestrial plants can vary from one tissue with a few lignified cells to an almost fully lignified tissue. This universal principle of plant growth and stabilization, accounting for all taxonomic units within vascular plants, suggests that the classical life form separation into herbs, shrubs and trees is not valid. An anatomical-based differentiation between ?wood?, ?woody? and ?woodiness? is also only meaningful if supplemented by insight on the particular plant section and its lignified proportion. We therefore recommend utilizing the botanically more neutral term ?stem anatomy? instead of ?wood anatomy?, which further implies integration of the xylem and bark of all terrestrial plants. Since dendrochronology considers shrubs, dwarf shrubs and perennial herbs in addition to trees, its semantic expansion toward ?xylemchronology? might be worthwhile considering.";2013;"wood, anatomy, plants, lignified, xylem"
"2815";"Linking sustainable development, global migration, climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction ? Identifying emerging issues";"Gudrun Schwilch and St{'e";"INTRODUCTION  Out-migration from mountain areas is leaving behind half families and elderly to deal with managing the land alongside daily life challenges. A potential reduction of labour force as well as expertise on cropping practices, maintenance of terraces and irrigation canals, slope stabilization, grazing, forest and other land management practices are further challenged by changing climate conditions and increased environmental threats. An understanding of the resilience of managed land resources in order to enhance adaptation to environmental and socio-economic variability, and evidence of the impact of Sustainable Land Management (SLM) on the mitigation of environmental threats have so far not sufficiently been tackled. The study presented here aims to find out how land management in mountains is being affected by migration in the context of natural hazards and climate change in two study sites, namely Quillacollo District of Bolivia and Panchase area of Western Nepal, and which measures are needed to increase resilience of livelihoods and land management practices. The presentation includes draft results from first field work periods in both sites. A context of high vulnerability According to UNISDR, vulnerability is defined as ?the characteristics and circumstances of a community, system or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard?.Hazards are another threat affecting people?s livelihood in mountainous area. They can be either natural or human induced. Landslides, debris flow and flood are affecting peopleGood land management can significantly reduce occurrence of hazards. In the opposite bad land management or land abandonment can lead to negative consequences on the land, and thus again increase vulnerability of people?s livelihoods.   METHODS  The study integrates bio-physical and socio-economic data through a case study as well as a mapping approach. From the social sciences, well-tested participatory qualitative methodologies, typically used in Vulnerability and Capacity Analyses, such as semi-structured interviews with so-called ?key informants?, transect walks, participatory risk and social resource mapping are applied. The bio-physical analysis of the current environmental conditions determining hazards and structural vulnerability are obtained from remote sensing analysis, field work studies, and GIS analysis The assessment of the consequences of migration in the area of origin is linked with a mapping and appraisal of land management practices (www.wocat.net, Schwilch et al., 2011). The WOCAT mapping tool (WOCAT/LADA/DESIRE 2008) allows capturing the major land management practices / technologies, their spread, effectiveness and impact within a selected area. Data drawn from a variety of sources are compiled and harmonised by a team of experts, consisting of land degradation and conservation specialists working in consultation with land users from various backgrounds. The specialists? and land users? knowledge is combined with existing datasets and documents (maps, GIS layers, high-resolution satellite images, etc.) in workshops that are designed to build consensus regarding the variables used to assess land degradation and SLM. This process is also referred to as participatory expert assessment or consensus mapping. The WOCAT mapping and SLM documentation methodologies are used together with participatory mapping and other socio-economic data collection (interviews, questionnaires, focus group discussions, expert consultation) to combine information about migration types and land management issues. GIS and other spatial visualization tools (e.g. Google maps) will help to represent and understand these links.   FIRST RESULTS  Nepal In Nepal, migration is a common strategy to improve the livelihoods. Migrants are mostly men and they migrate to other Asian countries, first to India and then to the Gulf countries. Only a few women are migrating abroad. Women migrate essentially to main Nepali cities when they can afford it. Remittances are used primarily for food and education; however they are hardly used for agricultural purposes. Besides traditional agriculture being maintained, only few new practices are emerging, such as vegetable farming or agroforestry. The land abandonment is a growing consequence of outmigration, resulting in the spreading of invasive species. However, most impacts of migration on land management are not yet clear. Moreover, education is a major concern for the respondents; they want their children having a better education and get better opportunities. Linked to this, unemployment is another major concern of the respondents, which in turn is ?solved? through outmigration. Bolivia Migration is a common livelihood strategy in Bolivia. In the area of study, whole families are migrating downward to the cities of the valleys or to other departments of Bolivia, especially to Chapare (tropics) for the coca production and to Santa Cruz. Some young people are migrating abroad, mostly to Argentina. There are few remittances and if those are sent to the families in the mountain areas, then they are mainly used for agriculture purpose. The impacts of migration on land management practices are not clear although there are some important aspects to be underlined. The people who move downward are still using their land and coming back during part of the week to work on it. As a consequence of this multi-residency, there is a tendency to reduce land management work or to change the way the land is used. As in Nepal, education is a very important issue in this area. There is no secondary school, and only one community has a primary school. After the 6th grade students have therefore to go down into the valley towns to study. The lack of basic education is pushing more and more people to move down and to leave the mountains.   CONCLUSIONS  This study is on-going, more data have to be collected to clearly assess the impacts of out-migration on land management in mountain areas. The first results of the study allow us to present a few interesting findings. The two case studies are very different, however in both areas, young people are not staying anymore in the mountains and leave behind half families and elderly to manage the land. Additionally in both cases education is a major reason for moving out, even though the causes are not always the same. More specifically, in the case of Nepal, the use of remittances underlines the fact that investment in agriculture is not the first choice of a family. In the case of Bolivia, some interesting findings showed that people continue to work on their lands even if they move downward. The further steps of the study will help to explore these interesting issues in more detail.

SLM strategies are interventions at the local to regional scale aiming at increasing productivity, protecting the natural resource base, and improving livelihoods. The global WOCAT initiative and its partners have developed harmonized frameworks to compile, evaluate and analyse the impact of SLM practices around the globe. Recent studies within the EU research project DESIRE developed a methodological framework that combines a collective learning and decision-making approach with use of best practices from the WOCAT database. In-depth assessment of 30 technologies and 8 approaches from 17 desertification sites enabled an evaluation of how SLM addresses prevalent dryland threats such as water scarcity, soil and vegetation degradation, low production, climate change, resource use conflicts and migration. Among the impacts attributed to the documented technologies, those mentioned most were diversified and enhanced production and better management of water and soil degradation, whether through water harvesting, improving soil moisture, or reducing runoff. Water harvesting offers under-exploited opportunities for the drylands and the predominantly rainfed farming systems of the developing world. Recently compiled guidelines introduce the concepts behind water harvesting and propose a harmonised classification system, followed by an assessment of suitability, adoption and up-scaling of practices. Case studies go from large-scale floodwater spreading that make alluvial plains cultivable, to systems that boost cereal production in small farms, as well as practices that collect and store water from household compounds. Once contextualized and set in appropriate institutional frameworks, they can form part of an overall adaptation strategy for land users. More field research is needed to reinforce expert assessments of SLM impacts and provide the necessary evidence-based rationale for investing in SLM. This includes developing methods to quantify and value ecosystem services, both on-site and off-site, and assess the resilience of SLM practices, as currently aimed at within the new EU CASCADE project.";2013;"desertification, sustainable, technology, water, research"

King and David Frank and Patrick Fonti";"The presence of soluble carbohydrates in the cambial zone, either from sugars recently produced during photosynthesis or from starch remobilized from storage organs, is necessary for radial tree growth. However, considerable uncertainties on carbohydrate dynamics and the consequences on tree productivity exist. This study aims to better understand the variation in different carbon pools at intra-annual resolution by quantifying how cambial zone sugar and starch concentrations fluctuate over the season and in relation to cambial phenology. A comparison between two physiologically different species growing at the same site, i.e., the evergreen Picea abies Karst. and the deciduous Larix decidua Mill., and between L. decidua from two contrasting elevations, is presented to identify mechanisms of growth limitation. Results indicate that the annual cycle of sugar concentration within the cambial zone is coupled to the process of wood formation. The highest sugar concentration is observed when the number of cells in secondary wall formation and lignification stages is at a maximum, subsequent to most radial growth. Starch disappears in winter, while other freeze-resistant non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) increase. Slight differences in NSC concentration between species are consistent with the differing climate sensitivity of the evergreen and deciduous species investigated. The general absence of differences between elevations suggests that the cambial activity of trees growing at the treeline was not limited by the availability of carbohydrates at the cambial zone but instead by environmental controls on the growing season duration.";2013;"carbohydrates, growth, dynamics, cambial, tree"

This paper explores the potential and suitability of J. mahafalensis as a biofuel feedstock. Seed samples were collected in the area of Soalara in south-western Madagascar in February and September 2011. Two agro-ecological zones (coastal area and calcareous plateau) and two plant age groups (below and above 10 years) were considered. These four sample groups were analyzed with regard to oil properties, element contents, and fatty acid profiles. Measured values differed greatly between the two harvests, probably owing to different climatic or storage conditions. No direct relation between age of trees or location and oil quality could be established. The analyses indicate that J. mahafalensis oil can be used in oil lamps, cooking stoves and stationary combustion engines for electrification or for biodiesel production. However, modifications in storage and extraction methods, as well as further processing steps are necessary to enable its utilization as a straight vegetable oil and feedstock for biodiesel production. If these technical requirements can be met, and if it turns out that J. mahafalensis oil is economically competitive in comparison with firewood, charcoal, paraffin and petroleum, it can be considered as a promising feedstock for rural energy supply.";2013;"renewable, potential, biofuel, oil, Madagascar"

(Paudorf paleosol). The upper section of the outcrop contains an up to 1 m thick pedocomplex that de-veloped during MIS 5. The differentiated sequence of loess-like sediment below, including a more than 2 m thick pedocomplex in its basal part, is an exceptional archive of landscape evolution from the Middle Pleistocene. Herein we present detailed paleopedologi-cal and sedimentological surveys, as well as first micromorphological observations to address the sequence in its entirety and the processes leading to its genesis. Furthermore, high resolution color and carbonate analyses, as well as detailed texture analyses, have resulted in a substantial database. The studies show that the loess sediments were subject to a polygenetic development under periglacial conditions reflected in eolian silt and fine sand accumulation, admixture of local material during (mostly solifluidal) redeposition and in situ processes. Horizons with signs of pedogenesis, particularly the two pedocomplexes, document longer phases of stability; the stages of development can be correlated to equivalent sequences and seen as paleoclimatic signals where chronological data are available. The upper pedo-complex is a Chernozem of the early last glacial (MIS 5c?[a?]), which developed in a solifluidal redeposited (MIS 5d) interglacial Cambisol (MIS 5e). Cryosols, typical for MIS 6 sequences, are present in the loess sediment below. The lower pedocomplex formed during several warm stages of varying intensities, with interruptions caused by colluvial processes and admixture of eolian sedi-ment during colder stages.";2013;"loess-paleosol, archive, landscape, genesis, paleoclimatic"

Moreover, access to clean water is of public health relevance, particularly in semi-arid and Sahelian cities due to the risks of water contamination and transmission of water-borne diseases. We conducted a study in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, to deepen the understanding of diarrhoeal incidence in space and time. We used an integrated geographical approach, combining socio-environmental, microbiological and epidemiological data from various sources, including spatially explicit surveys, laboratory analysis of water samples and reported diarrhoeal episodes. A geospatial technique was applied to determine the environmental and microbiological risk factors that govern diarrhoeal transmission. Statistical and cartographic analyses revealed concentration of unimproved sources of drinking water in the most densely populated areas of the city, coupled with a daily water allocation below the recommended standard of 20 l per person. Bacteriological analysis indicated that 93% of the non-piped water sources supplied at water points were contaminated with 10-80 coliform bacteria per 100 ml. Diarrhoea was the second most important disease reported at health centres, accounting for 12.8% of health care service consultations on average. Diarrhoeal episodes were concentrated in municipalities with the largest number of contaminated water sources. Environmental factors (e.g. lack of improved water sources) and bacteriological aspects (e.g. water contamination with coliform bacteria) are the main drivers explaining the spatio-temporal distribution of diarrhoea. We conclude that integrating environmental, microbiological and epidemiological variables with statistical regression models facilitates risk profiling of diarrhoeal diseases. Modes of water supply and water contamination were the main drivers of diarrhoea in this semi-arid urban context of Nouakchott, and hence require a strategy to improve water quality at the various levels of the supply chain.";2013;"human,right,water,contamination,diarrhoeal"

However, little is known about the socio-economic impacts of TCs in this region, probably because of the limited relevant loss data. Here, loss data from Munich RE's NatCatSERVICE database is used, a high-quality and widely consulted database of natural disasters. In the country-level loss normalisation technique we apply, the original loss data are normalised to present-day exposure levels by using the respective country's nominal gross domestic product at purchasing power parity as a proxy for wealth. The main focus of our study is on the question of whether the decadal-scale TC variability observed in the Northwest Pacific region in recent decades can be shown to manifest itself economically in an associated variability in losses. It is shown that since 1980 the frequency of TC-related loss events in the WNP exhibited, apart from seasonal and interannual variations, interdecadal variability with a period of about 22 yr ? driven primarily by corresponding variations of Northwest Pacific TCs. Compared to the long-term mean, the number of loss events was found to be higher (lower) by 14% (9%) in the positive (negative) phase of the decadal-scale WNP TC frequency variability. This was identified for the period 1980?2008 by applying a wavelet analysis technique. It was also possible to demonstrate the same low-frequency variability in normalised direct economic losses from TCs in the WNP region. The identification of possible physical mechanisms responsible for the observed decadal-scale Northwest Pacific TC variability will be the subject of future research, even if suggestions have already been made in earlier studies.";2013;"wnp, variability, losses, tc, economic"

"2846";"6th Annual international ESP conference 2013. Making ecosystem services count!";"Julie Gwendolin Z{\"a";"The north-eastern escarpment of Madagascar has been labelled a global biodiversity hotspot due to its extremely high rates of endemic species which are heavily threatened by accelerated deforestation rates and landscape change. The traditional practice of shifting cultivation or \"tavy\" used by the majority of land users in this area to produce subsistence rice is commonly blamed for these threats. A wide range of stakeholders ranging from conservation to development agencies, and from the private to the public sector has therefore been involved in trying to find solutions to protect the remaining forest fragments and to increase agricultural production. Consequently, provisioning, regulating and socio-cultural services of this forest-mosaic landscape are fundamentally altered leading to trade-offs between them and consequently new winners and losers amongst the stakeholders at different scales. However, despite a growing amount of evidence from case studies analysing local changes, the regional dynamics of the landscape and their contribution to such trade-offs remain poorely understood. This study therefore aims at using generalised landscape units as a base for the assessment of multi-level stakeholder claims on ecosystem services to inform negotiation, planning and decision making at a meso-scale. The presented study applies a mixed-method approach combining remote sensing, GIS and socio-economic methods to reveal current landscape dynamics, their change over time and the corresponding ecosystem service trade-offs induced by diverse stakeholder claims on the regional level. In a first step a new regional land cover classification for three points in time (1995, 2005 and 2011) was conducted including agricultural classes characteristic for shifting cultivation systems. Secondly, a novel GIS approach, termed ?landscape mosaics approach? originally developed to assess dynamics of shifting cultivation landscapes in Laos was applied. Through this approach generalised landscape mosaics were generated allowing for a better understanding of changes in land use intensities instead of land cover. As a next step we will try to use these landscape units as proxies to map provisioning and regulating ecosystem services throughout the region. Through the overlay with other regional background data such as accessibility and population density and information from a region-wide stakeholder analysis, multiscale trade-offs between different services will be highlighted. The trade-offs observed on the regional scale will then be validated through a socio-economic ground-truthing within selected sites at the local scale. We propose that such meso-scale knowledge is required by all stakeholders involved in decision making towards sustainable development of north-eastern Madagascar.";2013;"deforestation, biodiversity, landscape, stakeholders, ecosystem"

Recent studies have shown that chrysophyte stomatocysts, or simply cysts (sub-fossil algal remains of Chrysophyceae and Synurophyceae), are among the very few natural proxies that can be used to reconstruct cold-season temperatures. This study presents a quantitative, high-resolution (5-year), cold-season (Oct?May) temperature reconstruction based on sub-fossil chrysophyte stomatocysts in the annually laminated (varved) sediments of high-Alpine Lake Silvaplana, SE Switzerland (1,789 m a.s.l.), since AD 1500. We first explore the method used to translate an ecologically meaningful variable based on a biological proxy into a simple climate variable. A transfer function was applied to reconstruct the ?date of spring mixing? from cyst assemblages. Next, statistical regression models were tested to convert the reconstructed ?dates of spring mixing? into cold-season surface air temperatures with associated errors. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are thoroughly tested. One much-debated, basic assumption for reconstructions (?stationarity?), which states that only the environmental variable of interest has influenced cyst assemblages and the influence of confounding variables is negligible over time, is addressed in detail. Our inferences show that past cold-season air-temperature fluctuations were substantial and larger than those of other temperature reconstructions for Europe and the Alpine region. Interestingly, in this study, recent cold-season temperatures only just exceed those of previous, multi-decadal warm phases since AD 1500. These findings highlight the importance of local studies to assess natural climate variability at high altitudes.";2013;"cold-season, chrysophyte, stomatocysts, reconstruction, alpine"

S)";"Rixt de Jong and Lucien von Gunten and Antonio Maldonado and Martin Grosjean";"High-resolution reconstructions of climate variability that cover the past millennia are necessary to improve the understanding of natural and anthropogenic climate change across the globe. Although numerous records are available for the mid- and high-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, global assessments are still compromised by the scarcity of data from the Southern Hemisphere. This is particularly the case for the tropical and subtropical areas. In addition, high elevation sites in the South American Andes may provide insight into the vertical structure of climate change in the mid-troposphere. This study presents a 3000 yr-long austral summer (November to February) temperature reconstruction derived from the 210Pb- and 14C-dated organic sediments of Laguna Chepical (32?16' S, 70?30' W, 3050 m a.s.l.), a high-elevation glacial lake in the subtropical Andes of central Chile. Scanning reflectance spectroscopy in the visible light range provided the spectral index R570/R630, which reflects the clay mineral content in lake sediments. For the calibration period (AD 1901?2006), the R570/R630 data were regressed against monthly meteorological reanalysis data, showing that this proxy was strongly and significantly correlated with mean summer (NDJF) temperatures (R3 yr = ?0.63, padj = 0.01). This calibration model was used to make a quantitative temperature reconstruction back to 1000 BC.  The reconstruction (with a model error RMSEPboot of 0.33 ?C) shows that the warmest decades of the past 3000 yr occurred during the calibration period. The 19th century (end of the Little Ice Age (LIA)) was cool. The prominent warmth reconstructed for the 18th century, which was also observed in other records from this area, seems systematic for subtropical and southern South America but remains difficult to explain. Except for this warm period, the LIA was generally characterized by cool summers. Back to AD 1400, the results from this study compare remarkably well to low altitude records from the Chilean Central Valley and southern South America. However, the reconstruction from Laguna Chepical does not show a warm Medieval Climate Anomaly during the 12?13th century, which is consistent with records from tropical South America. The Chepical record also indicates substantial cooling prior to 800 BC. This coincides with well-known regional as well as global glacier advances which have been attributed to a grand solar minimum. This study thus provides insight into the climatic drivers and temperature patterns in a region for which currently very few data are available. It also shows that since ca. AD 1400, long-term temperature patterns were generally similar at low and high altitudes in central Chile.";2013;"climate, andes, reconstruction, proxy, temperature"

Some comments on the contribution of socialist models and Cuban agroecology";"S{'e";"While degrowth is about reducing energy and material flows in the economy while sustaining basic human needs, capitalism fosters the opposite trend. How then is degrowth to be implemented on a large scale? In line with different critical intellectual traditions, we argue that degrowth is unlikely to occur within an economy based on capital accumulation and free market of assets. Our objective is then to preliminarily investigate the links between economic structures, democratic principles, and degrowth. We do this, firstly, by briefly exploring some of the main theoretical models of economic democracy in order to find out their potential for achieving sustainable degrowth. In our view, models of self-managed socialism have the best potential for this. Secondly, we intend to learn some empirical lessons from a countrywide experience: Cuban agroecology, today?s largest reallife experience of agroecological ??degrowth??. Our hypothesis is that the Cuban economy, which limits the private accumulation of capital and of productive assets, is in a better position for achieving forms of sustainable degrowth than capitalist economies, but that it would be even more so with more democracy. The Cuban agricultural system faces the challenge to free itself from the central planning tradition. This could be achieved by following the current process of giving increasing autonomy to small producers. Specifically, we argue that small-scale farmer cooperatives have the best potential for achieving the degrowth-oriented goals of agroecology.";2012;"degrowth, capitalism, economic, democracy, cuban"

The approach accounts for changes in the sensor-shield characteristics that affect the energy balance dependent on ambient weather conditions (radiation, wind). An empirical model is formulated that reflects the main atmospheric processes and can be used in the correction step of a homogenization procedure. The model accounts for short- and long-wave radiation fluxes (including a snow cover component for albedo calculation) of a measurement system, such as a radiation shield. One part of the flux is further modulated by ventilation. The model requires only cloud cover and wind speed for each day, but detailed site-specific information is necessary. The final model has three free parameters, one of which is a constant offset. The three parameters can be determined, e.g., using the mean offsets for three observation times. The model is developed using the example of the change from the Wild screen to the Stevenson screen in the temperature record of Basel, Switzerland, in 1966. It is evaluated based on parallel measurements of both systems during a sub-period at this location, which were discovered during the writing of this paper. The model can be used in the correction step of homogenization to distribute a known mean step-size to every single measurement, thus providing a reasonable alternative correction procedure for high-resolution historical climate series. It also constitutes an error model, which may be applied, e.g., in data assimilation approaches.";2012;"physics, technique, homogenization, model, correction"

Such perspectives can illuminate the complex interplay between mountain ecosystems, environmental services and the determinants of human well-being. Repeat photography, long used in geographical fieldwork, is new as a qualitative research tool. This study uses a novel application of repeat photography as a diachronic photo-diary to examine local perceptions of change in ES in Sagarmatha National Park. Results show a consensus among locals on adverse changes to ES, particularly protection against natural hazards, such as landslides and floods, in the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

For a future REDD+ scheme, the correct identification of deforestation and forest degradation and linking these processes to land use is crucial. However, it is a key challenge to distinguish degradation and deforestation from temporal vegetation dynamics inherent to swiddening. In this article we present an approach for spatial delineation of swidden systems based on landscape mosaics. Furthermore we introduce a classification for change processes based on the change matrix of these landscape mosaics. Our approach is illustrated by a case study in Viengkham district in northern Laos. Over a 30-year time period the swidden landscapes have increased in extent and they have degraded, shifting from long crop?fallow cycles to short cycles. From 2007 to 2009 degradation within the swidden system accounted for half of all the landscape mosaics change processes. Pioneering shifting cultivation did not prevail. The landscape mosaics approach could be used in a swidden compatible monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system of a future REDD+ framework.";2012;"swidden, deforestation, degradation, landscape, classification"
"2928";"Carbon pools and poverty peaks in Lao PDR";"Cornelia Hett and Andreas Heinimann and Michael Epprecht and Peter Messerli and Kaspar Hurni";"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and enhancing forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+) is heavily promoted in Laos. REDD+ is often perceived as an opportunity to jointly address climate change and poverty and, therefore, could come timely for Laos to combine its prominent national target of poverty eradication with global climate mitigation efforts. Countrywide planning of the right approaches to REDD+ combined with poverty alleviation requires knowledge of the spatial combination of poverty and carbon stocks at the national level. This study combined spatial information on carbon stored in vegetation and on poverty and created carbon-poverty typologies for the whole country at the village level. We found that 11% of the villages of Laos have high to very high average village-level carbon stock densities and a predominantly poor population. These villages cover 20% of the territory and are characterized by low population density. Shifting cultivation areas in the northwestern parts of the country have a higher carbon mitigation potential than areas in the central and eastern highlands due to a more favorable climate. Finally, we found that in Laos the majority (58%) of poor people live in areas with low carbon stock densities without major potential to store carbon. Accordingly, REDD+ cannot be considered a core instrument for poverty alleviation. The carbon-poverty typologies presented here provide answers to basic questions related to planning and managing of REDD+. They could serve as a starting point for the design of systems to monitor both socioeconomic and environmental development at the national level.";2012;"forest, poverty, carbon, laos, typologies"

The Swiss climate observation network offers a high number and density of stations, many long and relatively complete daily to sub-daily temperature series, and well-documented station histories (i.e., metadata). However, for many climate observation networks outside of Switzerland, detailed station histories are missing, incomplete, or inaccessible. To correct these records, the use of reliable statistical break detection methods is necessary. Here, we apply three statistical break detection methods to high-quality Swiss temperature series and use the available metadata to assess the methods. Due to the complex terrain in Switzerland, we are able to assess these methods under specific local conditions such as the Foehn or crest situations. We find that the temperature series of all stations are affected by artificial breaks (average = 1 break point / 48 years) with discrepancies in the abilities of the methods to detect breaks. However, by combining the three statistical methods, almost all of the detected break points are confirmed by metadata. In most cases, these break points are ascribed to a combination of factors in the station history.";2012;"instrumental, temperature, series, breaks, swiss"

Interviews and freelisting exercises were conducted with 18 households at each study site. The amount of medicinal plant knowledge of households was compared in relation to their socioeconomic characteristics. Cluster analysis was applied to identify households that possessed similar knowledge. The different modes of knowledge transmission were also assessed. Our study shows that while the amount of plant knowledge is determined by individual motivation and experience, the type of knowledge is influenced by the community of residence, age, migratory activity, and market integration. Plant knowledge was equally transmitted vertically and horizontally, which indicates that it is first acquired within the family but then undergoes transformations as a result of subsequent contacts with other knowledge sources, including age peers.";2012;"patterns, distribution, transmission, medicinal, plant"
"2962";"Can Andean medicine coexist with biomedical healthcare? A comparison of two rural communities in Peru and Bolivia";"Sarah-Lan Mathez-Stiefel and Ina Vandebroek and Stephan Rist";"Background  It is commonly assumed that indigenous medical systems remain strong in developing countries because biomedicine is physically inaccessible or financially not affordable. This paper compares the health-seeking behavior of households from rural Andean communities at a Peruvian and a Bolivian study site. The main research question was whether the increased presence of biomedicine led to a displacement of Andean indigenous medical practices or to coexistence of the two healing traditions. Methodology  Open-ended interviews and free listing exercises were conducted between June 2006 and December 2008 with 18 households at each study site. Qualitative identification of households? therapeutic strategies and use of remedies was carried out by means of content analysis of interview transcriptions and inductive interference. Furthermore, a quantitative assessment of the incidence of culture-bound illnesses in local ethnobiological inventories was performed. Results  Our findings indicate that the health-seeking behavior of the Andean households in this study is independent of the degree of availability of biomedical facilities in terms of quality of services provided, physical accessibility, and financial affordability, except for specific practices such as childbirth. Preference for natural remedies over pharmaceuticals coexists with biomedical healthcare that is both accessible and affordable. Furthermore, our results show that greater access to biomedicine does not lead to less prevalence of Andean indigenous medical knowledge, as represented by the levels of knowledge about culture-bound illnesses. Conclusions  The take-home lesson for health policy-makers from this study is that the main obstacle to use of biomedicine in resource-poor rural areas might not be infrastructural or economic alone. Rather, it may lie in lack of sufficient recognition by biomedical practitioners of the value and importance of indigenous medical systems. We propose that the implementation of health care in indigenous communities be designed as a process of joint development of complementary knowledge and practices from indigenous and biomedical health traditions.";2012;"indigenous, health-seeking, coexistence, remedies, knowledge"

The design of effective flood risk mitigation strategies and their subsequent implementation is crucial for a sustainable development in mountain areas. The assessment of the dynamic evolution of flood risk is the pillar of any subsequent planning process that is targeted at a reduction of the expected adverse consequences of the hazard impact. Given these premises, firstly, a comprehensive method to derive flood hazard process scenarios for well-defined areas at risk is presented. Secondly, conceptualisations of a static and dynamic flood risk assessment are provided. These are based on formal schemes to compute the risk mitigation performance of devised mitigation strategies within the framework of economic cost-benefit analysis. In this context, techniques suitable to quantify the expected losses induced by the identified flood impacts are provided.";2012;"flood, risk, mitigation, assessment, development"

"2986";"Improvement of vulnerability curves using data from extreme events: debris flow event in South Tyrol";"Maria Papathoma-K{\"o";"Alpine hazards such as debris flow, floods, snow avalanches, rock falls, and landslides pose a significant threat to local communities. The assessment of the vulnerability of the built environment to these hazards in the context of risk analysis is a topic that is growing in importance due to global environmental change impacts as well as socio-economic changes. Hence, the vulnerability is essential for the development of efficient risk reduction strategies. In this contribution, a methodology for the development of a vulnerability curve as a function of the intensity of the process and the degree of loss is presented. After some modifications, this methodology can also be used for other types of hazards in the future. The curve can be a valuable tool in the hands of local authorities, emergency and disaster planners since it can assist decision making and cost?benefit analysis of structural protection measures by assessing the potential cost of future events. The developed methodology is applied in two villages (Gand and Ennewasser) located in Martell valley, South Tyrol, Italy. In the case study area, buildings and infrastructure suffered significant damages following a debris flow event in August 1987. The event caused extensive damage and was very well documented. The documented data were used to create a vulnerability curve that shows the degree of loss corresponding to different process intensities. The resulting curve can be later used in order to assess the potential economic loss of future events. Although the validation process demonstrated the reliability of the results, a new damage assessment documentation is being recommended and presented. This documentation might improve the quality of the data and the reliability of the curve. The presented research has been developed in the European FP7 project MOVE (Methods for the Improvement of Vulnerability Assessment in Europe).";2012;"alpine, hazards, vulnerability, methodology, assessment"

The focus of current process-based research is centered on the reaction of glaciers and runoff to climate change; spatially explicit impacts on soil moisture remain widely neglected. We spatio-temporally analyzed the impact of the climate on soil moisture in a mesoscale high mountain catchment to facilitate the development of mitigation and adaptation strategies at the level of vegetation patterns. Two regional climate models were downscaled using three different approaches (statistical downscaling, delta change, and direct use) to drive a hydrological model (WaSiM-ETH) for reference and scenario period (1960?1990 and 2070?2100), resulting in an ensemble forecast of six members. For all ensembles members we found large changes in temperature, resulting in decreasing snow and ice storage and earlier runoff, but only small changes in evapotranspiration. The occurrence of downscaled dry spells was found to fluctuate greatly, causing soil moisture depletion and drought stress potential to show high variability in both space and time. In general, the choice of the downscaling approach had a stronger influence on the results than the applied regional climate model. All of the results indicate that summer soil moisture decreases, which leads to more frequent declines below a critical soil moisture level and an advanced evapotranspiration deficit. Forests up to an elevation of 1800 m a.s.l. are likely to be threatened the most, while alpine areas and most pastures remain nearly unaffected. Nevertheless, the ensemble variability was found to be extremely high and should be interpreted as a bandwidth of possible future drought stress situations.";2012;"climate, moisture, impact, vegetation, drought"

Data were collected from 172 households in TFS and 270 households in SFS to analyze the effect of farming systems, parity, and calving season on key reproductive traits. The results show that farming systems significantly affect pubertal age, while parity has no significant effect on any of the key traits. The calving season significantly affects the postpartum anoestrus interval in TFS only. More than 50% of the cows in both systems have postpartum anoestrus intervals and calving intervals within the recommended values for cows in tropical countries.

"3021";"Impact of a Reduced Arctic Sea Ice Cover on Ocean and Atmospheric Properties";"Jan Sedl{'a";"The Arctic sea ice cover declined over the last few decades and reached a record minimum in 2007, with a slight recovery thereafter. Inspired by this the authors investigate the response of atmospheric and oceanic properties to a 1-yr period of reduced sea ice cover. Two ensembles of equilibrium and transient simulations are produced with the Community Climate System Model. A sea ice change is induced through an albedo change of 1 yr. The sea ice area and thickness recover in both ensembles after 3 and 5 yr, respectively. The sea ice anomaly leads to changes in ocean temperature and salinity to a depth of about 200 m in the Arctic Basin. Further, the salinity and temperature changes in the surface layer trigger a ?Great Salinity Anomaly? in the North Atlantic that takes roughly 8 yr to travel across the North Atlantic back to high latitudes. In the atmosphere the changes induced by the sea ice anomaly do not last as long as in the ocean. The response in the transient and equilibrium simulations, while similar overall, differs in specific regional and temporal details. The surface air temperature increases over the Arctic Basin and the anomaly extends through the whole atmospheric column, changing the geopotential height fields and thus the storm tracks. The patterns of warming and thus the position of the geopotential height changes vary in the two ensembles. While the equilibrium simulation shifts the storm tracks to the south over the eastern North Atlantic and Europe, the transient simulation shifts the storm tracks south over the western North Atlantic and North America. The authors propose that the overall reduction in sea ice cover is important for producing ocean anomalies; however, for atmospheric anomalies the regional location of the sea ice anomalies is more important.  While observed trends in Arctic sea ice are large and exceed those simulated by comprehensive climate models, there is little evidence based on this particular model that the seasonal loss of sea ice (e.g., as occurred in 2007) would constitute a threshold after which the Arctic would exhibit nonlinear, irreversible, or strongly accelerated sea ice loss. Caution should be exerted when extrapolating short-term trends to future sea ice behavior.";2012;"arctic, sea, ice, anomalies, modeling"

Our results show that EEMD can be used to extract low-frequency signals from the Dulan tree-ring data. The extracted low-frequency temperature trends in the two chronologies correlate significantly with Northern Hemisphere temperatures over the past two millennia. In addition, the newly reconstructed precipitation data have a higher standard deviation than that of data reconstructed with the conventional ordinary least squares and variance matching methods and yield the best amplitude match to the instrumental data. This study shows that EEMD is a powerful tool for extracting the full spectrum of climate information in tree-ring chronologies.";2012;"novel, data, adaptive, eemd, climate"

A potential method for disseminating the information other than the traditional academic is through film, but this means tailoring the material to this medium and in many cases collaborating with people who have the necessary skills. The aim of this article is to reflect on the experience of making a film from the researcher's perspective. I will in particular shed light on how the filmmaking team worked together and provide examples of the preceding research, as well as the shooting and editing of the film material. The long period of research leading up to the film was a major factor in its success. In addition, all of the people involved have to be willing to share their experiences, recognize each other's expertise and be able to compromise. The film was much more than just an extension of the ongoing multi-site qualitative research. The shooting not only provided new insights into people's lives but also forced me to think much harder about my research and \"the fieldwork.\" The additional costs and efforts related to the film can be justified by a transdisciplinary understanding of research that requires the results to be disseminated beyond academic circles, attract attention from policymakers and activists, and also allow the subjects of the research (who generally do not read English academic articles) to become an active audience.";2012;"disseminating, film, collaboration, research, audience"

The study ?Energy production from renewable sources in Alpine protected areas? examined the situation in Alpine parks today and the need for action from the viewpoint of park managements. Based on interviews with 21 Alpine protected areas in Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, the study shows the conflicts and the conflict potential as well as possible strategies. The interviews revealed that there is no remedy that applies to all parks. The need for action varies depending on the potential for conflict. Thus only some of the parks would prefer stricter rules, and energy targets or concepts are judged differently. Regardless of the path that a park chooses to follow, it will be unavoidable to deal with the issue. The study was devised by the Swiss Academy of Arts and Sciences (SAS) with the support of the Alpine Network of Protected Areas (ALPARC) and was funded by the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN).

Adjusting the management of remote alpine pastures bears a substantial climate change mitigation potential that can provide livelihood support for marginalized pastoralists through carbon payment. Landless pastoralists in Northern Pakistan seek higher income by cropping potatoes and peas over alpine pastures. However, tilling steep slopes without terracing exposes soil to erosion. Moreover, yields decline rapidly requiring increasing fertilizer inputs. Under these conditions, carbon payment could be a feasible option to compensate pastoralists for renouncing hazardous cropping while favoring pastoral activities. The study quantifies and compares C on cropped and grazed land. The hypothesis was that cropping on alpine pastures reduces former carbon storage. The study area located in the Naran valley of the Pakistani Himalayas receives an annual average of 819 mm of rain and 764 mm of snow. Average temperatures remain below 0?C from November to March while frost may occur all year round. A total of 72 soil core samples were collected discriminating land use (cropping, pasture), aspect (North, South), elevation (low 3000, middle 3100, and high 3200 m a.s.l.), and soil depth (shallow 0-10, deep 10-30 cm). Thirty six biomass samples were collected over the same independent variables (except for soil depth) using a 10x10x20 cm steal box inserted in the ground for each sample. Aboveground biomass and coarse roots were separated from the soil aggregate and oven-dried. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and biomass carbon (BC) were estimated through a potassium dichromate oxidation treatment. The samples were collected during the second week of October 2010 at the end of the grazing and cropping season and before the first snowfall. The data was statistically analyzed by means of a one-way analysis of variance. Results show that all variables taken separately have a significant effect on mean SOC [%]: crop/pasture 1.33/1.6, North/South 1.61/1.32, low/middle/high 1.09/1.62/1.68, shallow/deep 1.4/1.53. However, for BC, only land use has a significant effect with more than twice the amount of carbon in pastures [g m-2]: crop/pasture 127/318. These preliminary findings suggest that preventing the conversion of pastures into cropping fields in the Naran valley avoids an average loss of 12.2 t C ha-1 or 44.8 t CO2eq ha-1 representing a foreseeable compensation of 672 ? ha-1 for the Naran landless pastoralists who would renounce cropping. The ongoing study shall provide a complete picture for carbon payment integrating key aspects such as the rate of cropping encroachment over pastures per year, the methane leakage from the system due to livestock enteric fermentation, the expected cropping income vs. livestock income and the transaction costs of implementing the mitigation project, certifying it, and verifying carbon credits. A net present value over an infinite time horizon for the mitigation scenario shall be estimated on an iterative simulation to consider weather and price uncertainties. The study will also provide an estimate of the minimum price of carbon at which pastoralists would consider engaging in the mitigation activity.";2011;"rangelands, carbon, pastoralists, cropping, compensation"

"3084";"Jahrestagung der Bodenkundlichen Gesellschaft Schweiz: Knappe Ressourcen Boden: eine Herausforderung";"Kim Krause and Isabelle Providoli and William S. Currie and Harald Bugmann and Patrick Schleppi";"Despite numerous studies about nitrogen-cycling in forest ecosystems, many uncertainties remain, especially regarding the longer-term nitrogen accumulation. To contribute to filling this gap, the dynamic process-based model TRACE, with the ability to simulate 15N tracer redistribution in forest ecosystems was used to study N cycling processes in a mountain spruce forest of the northern edge of the Alps in Switzerland (Alptal, SZ). Most modeling analyses of N-cycling and C-N interactions have very limited ability to determine whether the process interactions are captured correctly. Because the interactions in such a system are complex, it is possible to get the whole-system C and N cycling right in a model without really knowing if the way the model combines fine-scale interactions to derive whole-system cycling is correct. With the possibility to simulate 15N tracer redistribution in ecosystem compartments, TRACE features a very powerful tool for the validation of fine-scale processes captured by the model. We first adapted the model to the new site (Alptal, Switzerland; long-term low-dose N-amendment experiment) by including a new algorithm for preferential water flow and by parameterizing of differences in drivers such as climate, N deposition and initial site conditions. After the calibration of key rates such as NPP and SOM turnover, we simulated patterns of 15N redistribution to compare against 15N field observations from a large-scale labeling experiment. The comparison of 15N field data with the modeled redistribution of the tracer in the soil horizons and vegetation compartments shows that the majority of fine-scale processes are captured satisfactorily. Particularly, the model is able to reproduce the fact that the largest part of the N deposition is immobilized in the soil. The discrepancies of 15N recovery in the LF and M soil horizon can be explained by the application method of the tracer and by the retention of the applied tracer by the well developed moss layer, which is not considered in the model. Discrepancies in the dynamics of foliage and litterfall 15N recovery were also observed and are related to the longevity of the needles in our mountain forest. As a next step, we will use the final Alptal version of the model to calculate the effects of climate change (temperature, CO2) and N deposition on ecosystem C sequestration in this regionally representative Norway spruce (Picea abies) stand.";2011;"nitrogen, cycling, forest, model, tracer"

The pre-instrumental evidence, consisting of flood marks and documentary data describing extreme events with the customary reference to specific landmarks, was ?calibrated? by comparing it with the instrumental series for the overlapping period between the two categories of evidence (1808?1900). Summer (JJA) floods were particularly frequent in the century between 1651?1750, when precipitation was also high. Severe winter (DJF) floods have not occurred since the late 19th century despite a significant increase in winter precipitation. Six catastrophic events involving a runoff greater than 6000 m 3 s-1 are documented prior to 1700. They were initiated by spells of torrential rainfall of up to 72 h (1480 event) and preceded by long periods of substantial precipitation that saturated the soils, and/or by abundant snowmelt.

The aim is to contribute to understanding the effects of these strategies and activities on forest regeneration, ecosystem services and on resource sustainability. The study examines the role played by the Committees of Natural Resources in forest exploitation. Data obtained from interviews and observations were used to complement and update a variety of existing data from oral and written sources dealing with forest regeneration in Cabo Delgado. These existing materials originate from previous studies conducted in the context of the ESAPP project that started more than two years ago. They include results from Learning for Sustainability workshops (LforS, http://www.cde.unibe.ch/Pages/Project/2/14/Learningfor- Sustainability-Extension-Approach.aspx), as well as field reports, academic studies, management plans used by concessionaires, and others. The interviews and observations took place more or less continuously from the beginning of this phase of the project in 2008. Interviews were systematically conducted with owners of concessions operating in the region, employees of logging companies, residents of villages within the existing concessions, government officials and others. It was not possible to collect information directly from poachers in part due to the illegal nature of their work. Information on these activities was obtained indirectly through members of the Committees of Natural Resources, the concessionaire, and its workers, as well as by observing the traces of extraction ? traps, bones and parts of slaughtered animals, tree stumps, material ready for transportation, etc. The main results indicate that extraction by the logging company MITI Ltd. and others acting in the region, by poachers and by other actors ? e.g. sawyers using manual saws ? put a lot of pressure on marketable species, particularly Millettia stuhlmannii, Afzelia quanzensis and Swartzia madagascariensis. Natural regeneration of forests in northern Cabo Delgado is being compromised by the combination of various extracting activities and uncontrolled fires. MITI Ltd. continued the pattern of exploitation of forest resources that was characteristic of companies operating in the region earlier, such as COMADEL. MITI Ltd. failed to implement the broad range of development and conservation activities encouraged by the new legislation on forest concessions that was created to promote sustainable use of resources.";2011;"forest, users, strategies, extraction, development"

Historical upper-air data are important in this endeavour, particularly in the maritime regions of the tropics and the southern hemisphere, where observations are extremely sparse. Here we present newly digitized and re-evaluated early ship-based upper-air data from two cruises: (1) kite and registering balloon profiles from onboard the ship SMS Planet on a cruise from Europe around South Africa and across the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific in 1906/1907, and (2) ship-based radiosonde data from onboard the MS Schwabenland on a cruise from Europe across the Atlantic to Antarctica and back in 1938/1939. We describe the data and provide estimations of the errors. We compare the data with a recent reanalysis (the Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project, 20CR, Compo et al., 2011) that provides global 3-D data back to the 19th century based on an assimilation of surface pressure data only (plus monthly mean sea-surface temperatures). In cruise (1), the agreement is generally good, but large temperature differences appear during a period with a strong inversion. In cruise (2), after a subset of the data are corrected, close agreement between observations and 20CR is found for geopotential height (GPH) and temperature notwithstanding a likely cold bias of 20CR at the tropopause level. Results are considerably worse for relative humidity, which was reportedly inaccurately measured. Note that comparing 20CR, which has limited skill in the tropical regions, with measurements from ships in remote regions made under sometimes difficult conditions can be considered a worst case assessment. In view of that fact, the anomaly correlations for temperature of 0.3?0.6 in the lower troposphere in cruise (1) and of 0.5?0.7 for tropospheric temperature and GPH in cruise (2) are considered as promising results. Moreover, they are consistent with the error estimations. The results suggest room for further improvement of data products in remote regions.";2011;"digitalised, historical, ship-based, upper-air, data"

It is contributing significantly to food security and food safety and has sustained  livelihood of the urban and peri-urban low income dwe llers in developing countries for many years.  Population increase due to rural-urban migration and natural - formal as well as informal - urbani- sation are competing with urban farming for available space and scarce water resources. A mul- titemporal and multisensoral urban change analysis over the period of 25 years (1982-2007) was  performed in order to measure and visualise the urban expansion along the Kizinga and Mzinga  valley in the south of Dar Es Salaam. Airphotos and VHR satellite data were analysed by using a  combination of a composition of anisotropic textural measures and spectral information.  The study revealed that unplanned built-up area is  expanding continuously, and vegetation covers  and agricultural lands decline at a fast rate. The validation showed that the overall classification  accuracy varied depending on the database. The extracted built-up areas were used for visual in- terpretation mapping purposes and served as information source for another research project. The  maps visualise an urban congestion and expansion of nearly 18% of the total analysed area that  had taken place in the Kizinga valley between 1982 and 2007. The same development can be ob- served in the less developed and more remote Mzinga valley between 1981 and 2002. Both areas  underwent fast changes where land prices still tend  to go up and an influx of people both from rural  and urban areas continuously increase the density with the consequence of increasing multiple  land use interests.";2011;"urban, agriculture, expansion, development, analysis"

To set up a sustainable financing scheme methodologies have to be provided that estimate, prevent and mitigate leakage, develop national and regional baselines, and estimate carbon benefits. With this research study this challenge was tried to be addressed by analysing a lowland rainforest in the Analanjirofo region in the district of Soanierana Ivongo, North East of Madagascar. For two distinguished forest degradation stages: ?low degraded forest? and ?degraded forest? aboveground biomass and carbon stock was assessed. The corresponding rates of carbon within those two classes were calculated and linked to a multi-temporal set of SPOT satellite data acquired in 1991, 2004 and 2009. Deforestation and particularly degradation and the related carbon stock developments were analysed. With the assessed data for the 3 years 1991, 2004 and 2009 it was possible to model a baseline and to develop a forest prediction for 2020 for Analanjirofo region in the district of Soanierana Ivongo.

It provides an example of how the integration of quantitative and qualitative research methods and data can enhance research into cultural aspects of natural hazards whilst simultaneously playing a key role in ensuring that the research results are of interest to a wide range of groups. Using a mixed-methods research approach was found to provide insight into complex factors that influence attitudes and actions towards bushfire amongst diverse landholders in rural?urban interface areas in south-east Australia. We argue that mixed-methods research is a powerful tool in building and enhancing a cultural geography that has policy relevance, retains analytical depth, and is acceptable to risk managers. The ability of cultural geography through mixed-methods research to illuminate how socio-cultural processes are central to environmental attitudes and preparedness behaviour has direct relevance to recent international discussions of how to manage the vulnerability of the growing number of people living in bushfire-prone rural?urban interface areas.";2011;"relevance,use,mixed-methods,quantitative,qualitative"
"3139";"The art of learning: wildfire, amenity migration and local environmental knowledge";"Christine Eriksen and Timothy Prior";"Communicating the need to prepare well in advance of the wildfire season is a strategic priority for wildfire management agencies worldwide. However, there is considerable evidence to suggest that although these agencies invest significant effort towards this objective in the lead up to each wildfire season, landholders in at-risk locations often remain under-prepared. One reason for the poor translation of risk information materials into actual preparation may be attributed to the diversity of people now inhabiting wildfire-prone locations in peri-urban landscapes. These people hold widely varying experiences, beliefs, attitudes and values relating to wildfire, which influence their understanding and interpretation of risk messages ? doing so within the constraints of their individual contexts. This paper examines the diversity of types of local environmental knowledge (LEK) present within wildfire-prone landscapes affected by amenity-led in-migration in south-east Australia. It investigates the ways people learn and form LEK of wildfire, and how this affects the ability of at-risk individuals to interpret and act on risk communication messages. We propose a practical framework that complements existing risk education mechanisms with engagement and interaction techniques (agency?community and within community) that can utilise LEK most effectively and facilitate improved community-wide learning about wildfire and wildfire preparedness.";2011;"wildfire, preparation, diversity, risk, knowledge"

"3150";"Reshaping Rural Extension: Learning for Sustainability (LforS): An Integrative and Learning-Based Advisory Approach for Rural Extension with Small-Scale Farmers";"Ernst Gabathuler and Felicitas Bachmann and Andreas Kl{\"a";"This publication offers concrete suggestions for implementing an integrative and learning-oriented approach to agricultural extension with the goal of fostering sustainable development. It targets governmental and non-governmental organisations, development agencies, and extension staff working in the field of rural development. The book looks into the conditions and trends that influence extension today, and outlines new challenges and necessary adaptations. It offers a basic reflection on the goals, the criteria for success and the form of a state-of-the-art approach to extension. The core of the book consists of a presentation of Learning for Sustainability (LforS), an example of an integrative, learning-oriented approach that is based on three crucial elements: stakeholder dialogue, knowledge management, and organizational development. Awareness raising and capacity building, social mobilization, and monitoring & evaluation are additional building blocks. The structure and organisation of the LforS approach as well as a selection of appropriate methods and tools are presented. The authors also address key aspects of developing and managing a learning-oriented extension approach. The book illustrates how LforS can be implemented by presenting two case studies, one from Madagascar and one from Mongolia. It addresses conceptual questions and at the same time it is practice-oriented. In contrast to other extension approaches, LforS does not limit its focus to production-related aspects and the development of value chains: it also addresses livelihood issues in a broad sense. With its focus on learning processes LforS seeks to create a better understanding of the links between different spheres and different levels of decision-making; it also seeks to foster integration of the different actors? perspectives.";2011;"sustainable, development, extension, learning, approach"

The region of the World Heritage Site now faces the responsibility to make these qualities visible and to preserve them for future generations. Consequently the qualities of the site must not be regarded in isolation but in the context of the entire region with its dynamics and developments. Regional monitoring is the observation and evaluation of temporal changes in target variables. It is thus an obligation towards UNESCO, who demands regular reports about the state of the listed World Heritage assets. It also allows statements about sustainable regional development and can be the basis for early recognition of threats to the outstanding qualities. Monitoring programmes face three major challenges: first, great care must be taken in defining the target qualities to be monitored or the monitoring would remain vague. Secondly, the selection of ideal indicators to describe these qualities is impeded by inadequate data quality and availability, compromises are inevitable. Thirdly, there is always an element of insecurity in the interpretation of the results as to what influences and determines the changes in the target qualities. The first survey of the monitoring programme confirmed the exceptional qualities of the region and also highlighted problematic issues.";2011;"unesco, heritage, region, monitoring, qualities"

"3155";"Research for Sustainable Development";"Urs Geiser and Ulrike M{\"u";"By the early 2000s, the Sustainable Livelihoods Approach/Framework (SLA or SLF) had emerged as a promising and challenging re-orientation of development research and practice. It also inspired our own research, launched around  2002, in the context of the Swiss National Centre of Competence in  Research (NCCR) North-South, a research partnership network linking research  organisations  in  the  South and Switzerland. The present article reflects on roughly eight years of insights gained into this livelihoods focus. It shows that the framework was initially a crucial facilitator of research cooperation across various disciplines, and that it provided, for example, students at the PhD and Master?s levels with a guided approach to analysing the ?real-life? problems and opportunities of rural people. Accordingly, the SLF was partly perceived as a new ?theory? of rural change and development. Gradually, however, we realised that its strength was limited to a kind of checklist for people-centred studies, with an inherent risk of leading to rather encyclopaedic listings of quantitative and/or qualitative data. Thorough debates among researchers involved were instrumental in revising the framework. The out-come was that the SLF indeed helped to focus research on core livelihood issues, but that (i) it is not an analytical framework which, on its own, makes it possible for researchers to grasp the complexity of interrelationships constituting livelihood realities; and that (ii) normatively, it tends to support a specific understanding of rural development along more neo-liberal lines. For a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by people, much more thorough theorising is required, as well as interlinkages with ongoing debates in the social sciences, parallel to ? but separate from ? the ?development-oriented livelihoods community?. This specifically concerns theories dealing with power, inequality, and everyday social practices. Such re-theorising leads to a challenging livelihoods perspective in critical development studies.";2011;"sustainable, livelihoods, research, framework, development"

Foundations, Experiences, and Perspectives";"Tobias Haller and Marc Galvin";"Participatory approaches to conservation have been applied worldwide by governments and non-governmental organisations. However, results from a comparative analysis of the impacts of global change on management issues in 13 protected areas in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and Europe show that in many cases the involvement of local people has remained limited, and economic gains for local livelihoods have been limited or non-existent. Viewed from a ?new institutionalist? perspective and focusing on power relations and ideologies, the results of this study carried out within the framework of the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) North-South show that in African cases local people do not feel part of the process and, therefore, become disengaged. In Asia, and even more so in Latin America, local indigenous peoples and their leaders support protected areas as a means to gain political rights over areas threatened by immigration. The European (Swiss) case is the only one where political rights and economic incentives present a context in which participation is of direct interest to local people. Meanwhile, recent debates on new global conservation developments in the context of climate change policy indicate a growing tendency to treat conservation as a commodity. We argue that this can have problematical effects on efforts to devolve power to the local level in the context of conservation.";2011;"conservation, participatory, global, power, local"

In Laos REDD is abundantly promoted by the government and development agencies as a potential option for rural development. Yet, basic information for carbon management is missing: to date no knowledge is available at the national level on the quantities of carbon stored in the Lao landscapes. In this study we present an approach for spatial assessment of vegetation-based carbon stocks. We used Google Earth, Landsat and MODIS satellite imagery and refined the official national land cover data to assess carbon stocks. Our study showed that more than half (52%) of carbon stock of Laos is stored in natural forests, but that 70% of this stock is located outside of national protected areas. On the basis of two carbon-centered land use scenarios we calculated that between 30 and 40 million tons of carbon could be accumulated in shifting cultivation areas; this is less than 3% of the existing total stock. Our study suggests that the main focus of REDD in Laos should be on the conservation of existing carbon stocks, giving highest priority to the prevention of deforestation outside of national protected areas.";2011;"redd, laos, carbon, forests, conservation"

In policy research, governance has become an important focus of attention; but debates show a lack of clarity at the conceptual level and a confusion between the use of the concept for prescriptive and analytical purposes. The present article is based on the hypothesis that using a clarified, non-normative governance perspective in policy research can contribute to an improved understanding of political processes, including formal and unrecognised ones, those embedded in larger and smaller social systems, as well as both vertical and horizontal political arrangements. The paper is the result of a collaborative engagement with the concept of governance within several networks, leading to the development of the Governance Analytical Framework (GAF). The GAF is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, based on five analytical tools: problems, actors, social norms, processes, and nodal points. Besides describing the conceptual sources and analytical purpose of these five tools, the paper presents examples of how the GAF can be operationalised.";2011;"societies, decisions, norms, governance, analytical"

The political support for gender issues is reflected in presidential directives on various actions for achieving gender equality such as the establishment of gender desk officers and ensuring 30 per cent female representation in government. Despite the well-advanced gender mainstreaming policy in Kenya, few policies focus on climate change and even fewer on its inter-linkages with gender. At the field level, encrusted traditions, inadequately trained staff, limited financial resources, and limited awareness of the inter-linkages between gender and climate change remain major challenges to promoting gender equality in the work of government organisations. The paper thus proposes measures for addressing these challenges and strengthening gender equality in responses to climate change.";2011;"kenyan, policies, gender, climate, equality"

As pastoral and agro-pastoral production conditions change due to various factors including market conditions, climate variability and change, pastoralists and agro-pastoralists are increasingly faced with the challenge of finding alternative livelihoods. Bio-enterprises offer such alternatives or complementary activities for rural actors to adapt to changing socio-ecological conditions. This study examines the roles of bio-enterprise initiatives from a livelihood perspective and identifies the features important for such initiatives to reduce poverty and improve the adaptive capacities of pastoralists and agro-pastoralists. It draws on four different bio-enterprise initiatives on agro-pastoral and pastoral livelihoods and on improved natural resources management (NRM) in the drylands of Kenya. Data were collected through interviews, focus group discussions, informal discussions and the study of reports. Results shows among other factors that diversification into enterprises requires cooperation among the stakeholders with their varying experiences in development, NRM and business development. Other factors such as sustained financial support, capacity development to survive the market introduction phase, as well as quantity and quality of the product, are critical. Mentoring proved to be a driver of success in some initiatives.";2011;"bio-enterprises, adaptation, livelihood, poverty, initiatives"

Sher and Urs Martin Wiesmann";"There are clear signs that the agro-pastoralists in the Himalayan and Hindu-Kush mountain ranges will have less cropping opportunities due to reduced possibilities for irrigated agriculture as a result of climate change. The importance of extensive livestock production based on well adapted livestock species may once again increase. This calls for a better documentation and understanding of the adaptation capabilities of indigenous breeds considering a changing environment. The current study investigates the adaptive traits of the Azikheli buffalo to mountain environments through calculating mean, standard error and percentages for different variables. Results from this study suggest that the brown coat color, the small body size and the high fertility are adaptive traits of the Azikheli buffalo that may well suit harsh mountainous environment conditions with greater climate variability. Local farmers find it hard to sustain the Azikheli buffalo?s key adaptive traits because of a low bull to buffalo ratio, possibility of insemination with semen from imported breeds and a lack of institutional support to conserve the Azikheli breed. The breed is crucial for sustaining custodian communities in these mountains and thus needs to be conserved.";2011;"agro-pastoralists, himalayan, livestock, adaptation, azikheli"

By some vulnerability measures it is the most vulnerable among all 28 countries in the World Bank?s Europe and Central Asia Region ? ECA (World Bank 2009). The rural population, with its relatively high incidence of poverty, is particularly vulnerable. The Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) in Tajikistan (2011) provided an opportunity to conduct a farm-level survey with the objective of assessing various dimensions of rural population?s vulnerability to risk and their perception of constraints to farming operations and livelihoods. The survey should be accordingly referred to as the 2011 PPCR survey. The rural population in Tajikistan is highly agrarian, with about 50% of family income deriving from agriculture (see Figure 4.1; also LSMS 2007 ? own calculations). Tajikistan?s agriculture basically consists of two groups of producers: small household plots ? the successors of Soviet ?private agriculture? ? and dehkan (or ?peasant?) farms ? new family farming structures that began to be created under relevant legislation passed after 1992 (Lerman and Sedik, 2008). The household plots manage 20% of arable land and produce 65% of gross agricultural output (GAO). Dehkan farms manage 65% of arable land and produce close to 30% of GAO. The remaining 15% of arable land is held in agricultural enterprises ? the rapidly shrinking sector of corporate farms that succeeded the Soviet kolkhozes and sovkhozes and today produces less than 10% of GAO (TajStat 2011) The survey conducted in May 2011 focused on dehkan farms, as budgetary constraints precluded the inclusion of household plots. A total of 142 dehkan farms were surveyed in face-to-face interviews. They were sampled from 17 districts across all four regions ? Sughd, Khatlon, RRP, and GBAO. The districts were selected so as to represent different agro-climatic zones, different vulnerability zones (based on the World Bank (2011) vulnerability assessment), and different food-insecurity zones (based on WFP/IPC assessments). Within each district, 3-4 jamoats were chosen at random and 2-3 farms were selected in each jamoat from lists provided by jamoat administration so as to maximize the variability by farm characteristics. The sample design by region/district is presented in Table A, which also shows the agro-climatic zone and the food security phase for each district. The sample districts are superimposed on a map of food security phases based on IPC April 2011.";2011;"tajikistan, vulnerability, climate, agriculture, survey"

The article examines a set of land use policies and practices that can be used to mitigate the vulnerability of Tajikistan?s large rural population, primarily by increasing family incomes. Empirical evidence from Tajikistan and other CIS countries suggests that families with more land and higher commercialization earn higher incomes and achieve higher well-being. The recommended policy measures that are likely to increase rural family incomes accordingly advocate expansion of smallholder farms, improvement of livestock productivity, increase of farm commercialization through improvement of farm services, and greater diversification of both income sources and the product mix. The analysis relies for supporting evidence on official statistics and recent farm surveys. Examples from local initiatives promoting sustainable land management practices and demonstrating the implementation of the proposed policy measures are presented.";2011;"tajikistan, vulnerability, land use, income, policy"

H{\"u";"Recent flood events in Switzerland and Western Austria in 2005 were characterised by an increase in impacts and associated losses due to the transport of woody material. As a consequence, protection measures and bridges suffered considerable damages. Furthermore, cross-sectional obstructions due to woody material entrapment caused unexpected flood plain inundations resulting in severe damage to elements at risk. Until now, the transport of woody material is neither sufficiently taken into account nor systematically considered, leading to prediction inaccuracies during the procedure of hazard mapping. To close this gap, we propose a modelling approach that (1) allows the estimation of woody material recruitment from wood-covered banks and flood plains; (2) allows the evaluation of the disposition for woody material entrainment and transport to selected critical configurations along the stream and that (3) enables the delineation of hazard process patterns at these critical configurations. Results from a case study suggest the general applicability of the concept. This contribution to woody material transport analysis refines flood hazard assessments due to the consideration of woody material transport scenarios.";2011;"flood, impact, woody, material, hazard"

Ongoing climate change processes are projected to have a high impact on the HKH region, and accelerated warming has been reported in the Himalayas. These climate change impacts will be superimposed on a variety of other environmental and social stresses, adding to the complexity of the issues. The sustainable use of natural resources is crucial to the long-term stability of the fragile mountain ecosystems in the HKH and to sustain the socio-ecological resilience that forms the basis of sustainable livelihoods in the region. In order to be prepared for these challenges, it is important to take stock of previous research. The ?People and Resource Dynamics Project? (PARDYP), implemented by International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), provides a variety of participatory options for sustainable land management in the HKH region. The PARDYD project was a research for development project that operated in five middle mountain watersheds across the HKH ? two in Nepal and one each in China, India, and Pakistan. The project ran from 1996 to 2006 and focused on addressing the marginalisation of mountain farmers, the use and availability of water, issues relating to land and forest degradation and declining soil fertility, the speed of regeneration of degraded land, and the ability of the natural environment to support the growing needs of the region?s increasing population. A key learning from the project was that the opinion of land users is crucial to the acceptance (and, therefore, successful application) of new technologies and approaches. A major challenge at the end of every project is to promote knowledge sharing and encourage the cross-fertilization of ideas (e.g., in the case of PARDYP, with other middle mountain inhabitants and practitioners in the region) and to share lessons learned with a wider audience. This paper will highlight how the PARDYP findings, including ways of addressing soil fertility and water scarcity, have been mainstreamed in the HKH region through capacity building (international, regional, and national training courses), networking, and the provision of backstopping services. In addition, in view of the challenges in watershed management in the HKH connected to environmental change, the lessons learned from the PARDYP are now being used by ICMOD to define and package climate change proof technology options to address climate change adaptation.";2011;"vulnerable, climate, challenges, resources, capacity"

These plantations on former scrublands curtail access by livestock owned by landless pastoralists and create social tension.

The choice of fodder tree species, their nutritional value and distribution within the complex socio-ecological system is explained. This study also explores the suitability of these trees at different elevations, sites and transhumant routes.

This paper compiles methodological approaches which to date have been little reported in the literature. It draws lessons from these experiences and identifies common elements and future pathways as a basis for a global approach. The paper starts with local level methods where the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT) framework catalogues SLM case studies. This tool has been included in the local level assessment of Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands (LADA) and in the EU-DESIRE project. Complementary site-based approaches can enhance an ecological process-based understanding of SLM variation. At national and sub-national levels, a joint WOCAT/LADA/DESIRE spatial assessment based on land use systems identifies the status and trends of degradation and SLM, including causes, drivers and impacts on ecosystem services. Expert consultation is combined with scientific evidence and enhanced where necessary with secondary data and indicator databases. At the global level, the Global Environment Facility (GEF) knowledge from the land (KM:Land) initiative uses indicators to demonstrate impacts of SLM investments. Key lessons learnt include the need for a multi-scale approach, making use of common indicators and a variety of information sources, including scientific data and local knowledge through participatory methods. Methodological consistencies allow cross-scale analyses, and findings are analysed and documented for use by decision-makers at various levels. Effective M&A of SLM [e.g. for United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)] requires a comprehensive methodological framework agreed by the major players.";2011;"sustainable, land, management, assessment, global"

The drivers and actors and the process of changing agricultural water governance are its particular focus. The assumptions discussed are: (i) the degree of planned and anticipatory top-down implementation processes decreases if actions are more decentralized and are introduced at the regional and local level; (ii) the degree of autonomous and responsive adaptation approaches seems to grow with actions at a lower administrative level. Looking at processes of institutional change, a variety of drivers and actors are at work such as changing perceptions of predicted climate impacts; international obligations which force politicians to take action; socio-economic concerns such as the cost of not taking action; the economic interests of the private sector. Drivers are manifold and often interact and, in many cases, reforms in the sector are driven by and associated with larger reform agendas. The results of the study may serve as a starting point in assisting water agencies in developing countries with the elaboration of coping strategies for tackling climate change-induced risks related to agricultural water management.";2011;"agricultural, water, governance, climate change, adaptation"

Murray and Birgit Terhorst and Sumiko Tsukamoto and Manfred Frechen and Tobias Sprafke";"The age of most Lower Austria loess deposits is unknown; this is especially true for Middle Pleistocene loess because there is no generally applicable dating method available. Recently it has been shown that infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signals measured at elevated temperatures after an infrared (IR) stimulation are more stable than the standard IRSL signal measured at 50?C. These signals offer new opportunities to extend the datable age range by minimising or circumventing the undesirable anomalous fading correction. In this study we apply, for the first time, two post-IR IRSL single-aliquot regenerative (SAR) dating protocols to polymineral fine-grain samples from three loess/palaeosol sequences in Lower Austria. The luminescence characteristics and ages derived from these protocols are compared with the IRSL results obtained at 50?C. Recycling ratios, recuperation and dose recovery tests show that these protocols are applicable to the loess under investigation. Fading rates for the post-IR IRSL signals are significantly smaller than for the IRSL at 50?C; the differences in fading rates between post-IR IRSL at 225?C and post-IR IRSL at 290?C are less obvious. Significant fading corrections are needed for the ages derived from the IRSL signal at 50?C. From our study we conclude that the fading corrected post-IR IRSL at 225?C and the fading uncorrected post-IR IRSL at 290?C provide the best age estimates; we prefer the latter because no fading correction is apparently needed.

The millennial-scale decreasing solar insolation in the Northern Hemisphere summer lead to Northern Hemisphere cooling, a southern shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and a weakening of the Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon systems. On the multidecadal to multicentury-scale, periods of more stable and warmer climate were interrupted by several cold relapses, at least in the Northern Hemisphere extra-tropical area. Based on carefully selected 10,000-year-long time series of temperature and humidity/precipitation, as well as reconstructions of glacier advances, the spatiotemporal pattern of six cold relapses during the last 10,000 years was analysed and presented in form of a Holocene Climate Atlas (HOCLAT; see http://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/research/projects/holocene_atlas/). A clear cyclicity was not found, and the spatiotemporal variability of temperature and humidity/precipitation during the six specific cold events (8200, 6300, 4700, 2700, 1550 and 550 years BP) was very high. Different dynamical processes such as meltwater flux into the North Atlantic, low solar activity, explosive volcanic eruptions, and fluctuations of the thermohaline circulation likely played a major role. In addition, internal dynamics in the North Atlantic and Pacific area (including their complex interaction) were likely involved.";2011;"holocene, climate, cold, variability, dynamics"

Thus, our view goes beyond the disciplinary approaches of forestry, agronomy, biology or zoology, and also of the social sciences, namely anthropology, history, sociology, political science or economics. The present study aims to establish a dialogue and create synergies between Miti Ltd. ? the logging company and owner of the forest concessions ? as well as government and state structures at the various levels and the communities ? through the Committees on Natural Resources ? in order to promote the sustainable use of resources and ecosystems. The research methodology we used can broadly be described as moderated transdisciplinary interaction for action-research based on the approach known as Learning for Sustainability (LforS, http://www.cde.unibe.ch/Pages/Project/2/14/Learning-for-Sustainability-Extension-Approach.aspx). The research methods used include: LforS seminars; field work; forests observations focusing, among others, on ecosystems, trees, wildlife, and burned areas; visits to farms; and interviews. We conducted both collective interviews and individual interviews, including with key informants. The main results indicate that members of the Committee on Natural Resources have a dual attitude: their statements defend the paradigm of sustainable use of natural resources as well as their own immediate monetary gain. They are willing to apply the values, concepts and theories of sustainable development that underpin the establishment of Committees on Natural Resources if they are paid for their work or if they can derive direct benefits from it, i.e. if they can earn a salary or allowance. If this does not happen, however, they are willing to allow actors to engage in illegal hunting or logging activities. This dual attitude also exists in relation to forestry operators. If the concession workers pay the committee members in cash or provide goods, they can run their business even if they violate the law. Natural forest regeneration in Nkonga and Namiune already shows the impact of such use. Although there are many saplings that could basically ensure continuous regeneration under sustainable management, repeated burning is damaging the young trees, deforming them and killing a great number of them. Campaigns against uncontrolled fires are ineffective because the administrative and political authorities have a dual attitude as well and are also part of the group that uses resources to their own profit and benefit. There are institutional structures within the administration, populations, and communities to perform regulating functions, create and implement rules, punish offenders, and oversee resource use. However, they feel that since they are not paid for performing these functions, they do not have to do so. This attitude shows a lack of awareness, but also indicates a situation where everyone seeks to derive maximum benefits from existing resource use patterns. Anything goes.";2010;"miombo, natural resources, synergies, transdisciplinary, sustainable"

The recurring conflicts between the two groupings are rather a result of a reaction by a community which has been marginalized over the years. A survey to analyze conflicts, institutional frameworks, policies, laws and regulations governing NRs utilization by pastoral and farmers was conducted in the Lake Rukwa Basin in 2008. The study noted violent conflicts and their causes, including the scarcity of NRs, poor local institutional frameworks and deeper socio-cultural aspects among pastoralists and farmers. The conflicts have become major impediments to the developmental activities in the study areas, to a degree that requires intervention. This, therefore, calls for reorganization of local institutional framework, policies, laws and regulations and participatory planning and co-management of NRs as part of conflicts management and sustainable utilization of them.

Social capital-vulnerability links through a gender lens";"Susan Thieme and Karin Astrid Siegmann";"Processes of migration are embedded in social networks, more recently conceptualised as social capital, from sending households to migrants? formal and informal associations at their destinations. These processes are often assumed to reduce individuals, households and economies? vulnerabilities and thus attract policy-makers? attention to migration management. The paper aims to conceptualise the gendered interface between social capital and vulnerability. It utilises Bourdieu?s notion of social capital as an analytical starting point. To illuminate our conceptual thoughts we refer to empirical examples from migration research from various Asian countries. Bourdieu?s theory highlights the social construction of gendered vulnerability. It goes beyond that by identifying the investment in symbolic capital of female honour as an indirect investment in social and, ultimately, economic capital. This gender-differentiated unequal investment and these capitals? incomplete fungibility, though, makes women not just indirect members of social networks but mere objects contributing as ?symbolic currency? within them, often without being able to capitalise on the very relations. Based on Bourdieu?s theory, we suggest a shift from the investigation of women?s exclusion from and gender inequality within social networks to an analysis of masculine domination. It appears to be directly associated with the degree of vulnerability that women experience.";2010;"migration, social capital, gender, vulnerability, bourdieu"

It is contributing significantly to food security and food safety and has sustained livelihood of the urban and peri-urban low income dwellers in developing countries for many years. Population increase due to rural-urban migration and natural, coupled with formal as well as infor-mal urbanization are competing with urban farming for available space and scarce water resources. A multitemporal multisensoral urban change analysis over the period of 25 years (1982-2007) was performed in order to measure and visualize the urban expansion along the Kizinga and Mzinga valley in the South of Dar es Salaam. Airphotos and VHR satellite data were analyzed by using a combination of a composition of anisotropic textural measures and spectral information. The study revealed that unplanned built-up area is expanding continuously and vegetation covers and agricultural lands decline at a fast rate. The validation showed that the overall classification accuracy varied depending on the database. The extracted built-up areas were used for visual in-terpretation mapping purposes and served as information source for another research project. The maps visualize an urban congestion and expansion of nearly 18% of the total analyzed area that had taken place in the Kizinga valley between 1982 and 2007. The same development can be ob-served in the less developed and more remote Mzinga valley between 1981 and 2002. Both areas underwent fast changes where land prices still tend to go up and an influx of people both from rural and urban areas continuously increase density with the consequence of increasing multiple land use interests.";2010;"urban, agriculture, expansion, water, change"

In the classical system for validation and dissemination of scientific knowledge, journals focus on knowledge exchange within the academic community and do not specifically address a ?life-world audience?. Within a North-South context, another knowledge divide is added: the peer review process excludes a large proportion of scientists from the South from participating in the production of scientific knowledge (Karlsson et al. 2007). Mountain Research and Development (MRD) is a journal whose mission is based on an editorial strategy to build the bridge between research and development and ensure that authors from the global South have access to knowledge production, ultimately with a view to supporting sustainable development in mountains. In doing so, MRD faces a number of challenges that we would like to discuss with the td-net community, after having presented our experience and strategy as editors of this journal. MRD was launched in 1981 by mountain researchers who wanted mountains to be included in the 1992 Rio process. In the late 1990s, MRD realized that the journal needed to go beyond addressing only the scientific community. It therefore launched a new section addressing a broader audience in 2000, with the aim of disseminating insights into, and recommendations for, the implementation of sustainable development in mountains. In 2006, we conducted a survey among MRD?s authors, reviewers, and readers (Wymann et al. 2007): respondents confirmed that MRD had succeeded in bridging the gap between research and development. But we realized that MRD could become an even more efficient tool for sustainability if development knowledge were validated: in 2009, we began submitting ?development? papers (?transformation knowledge?) to external peer review of a kind different from the scientific-only peer review (for ?systems knowledge?). At the same time, the journal became open access in order to increase the permeability between science and society, and ensure greater access for readers and authors in the South. We are currently rethinking our review process for development papers, with a view to creating more space for communication between science and society, and enhancing the co-production of knowledge (Roux 2008). Hopefully, these efforts will also contribute to the urgent debate on the ?publication culture? needed in transdisciplinary research (Kueffer et al. 2007).";2010;"development, research, journal, knowledge, sustainable"

"3330";"Migration and animal husbandry: Competing or complementary livelihood strategies. Evidence from Kyrgyzstan";"Nadia Schoch and Bernd Steimann and Susan Thieme";"Animal husbandry and labour migration are important livelihood strategies for a large proportion of the rural population in developing countries. Up to now, the two strategies have usually been studied by looking at either one or the other; their interlinkages have rarely been examined. Based on a case study in rural Kyrgyzstan, the aim of this paper is to explore the links between animal husbandry and labour migration. Results show that for most rural households, livestock is crucial yet not sufficient to make a living. Therefore, many people diversify their income sources by migrating to work elsewhere. This generates cash for daily expenses and the acquisition of new livestock, but also leads to an absence of workforce in households. Yet since remittances usually exceed the expenses for hiring additional workforce, most people consider migration profitable. From a socio?economic point of view, migration and animal husbandry can thus be considered important complementary livelihood strategies for the rural Kyrgyz population, at least for the time being. In the long term, however, the failure of young migrants to return to rural places and their settlement in urban areas might also cause remittance dependency and lead to an increasing lack of qualified labour. From an environmental point of view, the investment of remittances into animal husbandry poses challenges to sustainable pasture management. Increasing livestock numbers in rural areas raise pressure on pasture resources. Since most people consider animal husbandry their main future prospect while continuing to use pastures in a fairly unsustainable way, this may further exacerbate the over?utilization of pastures in future.";2010;"husbandry, migration, rural, livelihood, pasture"

It remains however unknown whether the Clean Development Mechanism will accelerate the planting of trees in Non Annex I dryland countries. We estimated the price of carbon at which a farmer would be indifferent between his customary activity and the planting of trees to trade carbon credits, along an aridity gradient. Carbon yields were simulated by means of the CO2FIX v3.1 model for Pinus halepensis with its respective yield classes along the gradient (Arid ? 100mm to Dry Sub Humid conditions ? 900mm). Wheat and pasture yields were predicted on somewhat similar nitrogen-based quadratic models, using 30 years of weather data to simulate moisture stress. Stochastic production, input and output prices were afterwards simulated on a Monte Carlo matrix. Results show that, despite the high levels of carbon uptake, carbon trading by afforesting is unprofitable anywhere along the gradient. Indeed, the price of carbon would have to raise unrealistically high, and the certification costs would have to drop significantly, to make the Clean Development Mechanism worthwhile for non annex I dryland countries farmers. From a government agency's point of view the Clean Development Mechanism is attractive. However, such agencies will find it difficult to demonstrate ?additionality?, even if the rule may be somewhat flexible. Based on these findings, we will further discuss why the Clean Development Mechanism, a supposedly pro-poor instrument, fails to assist farmers in Non Annex I dryland countries living at minimum subsistence level.";2010;"trees, carbon, mechanism, profitability, dryland"

We will present these recent works and discuss new concepts and methodologies of environmental studies with potential relevance in the field of Negev Bedouin studies. We will then identify research areas where environmental and development approaches converge or diverge with mainstream social sciences on this specific field of research. While most of the Bedouin population in southern Israel lives in urban centers in the Northern Negev, a large part of Bedouin people live in unrecognized clusters of houses in remote areas. Extensive livestock rearing is an important source of livelihood at least for non-urbanized Bedouin, the latter forming the lowest economic strata of the Israeli spectrum of incomes. Numerous stressors affect this Bedouin community enduring uncertain livelihood and access to land. The erratic precipitations from year to year and long-term changes in precipitation trends are a source of great uncertainty. With a significant price increase for feeding supplements to compensate for dry years, livestock rearing has become a harsher source of livelihood. Land scarcity for grazing adds to the difficulty in ensuring enough income for living. Studies in the last 15 years have described several livelihood strategies based on a livestock rearing semi-nomadic economy in the Negev. A number of other analyses have shown how Bedouin herders and governmental agencies have found agreements at the advantage of both, the agencies and the herders. New concepts such as transformability, resilience and adaptation strategies are important tools to analyze the capacity of vulnerable communities to cope with an ever increasing livelihood uncertainty. Such research concepts can assist in better understanding how Bedouin herders in the Negev may adapt to climate and political risks.";2010;"negev, bedouin, environmental, livelihood, adaptation"

It also investigated farmers? motivation for and assessment of conversion to organic farming. Cotton yields on organic farms were found to be 10% lower whereby input costs per unit were 42% lower, which resulted in organic farmers having a 20% higher revenue from cotton. Due to lower input costs and organic and fair trade price premiums the average gross margin from organic cotton was 27%. In addition to direct economic benefits organic farmers enjoy a number of additional benefits such as easy access to credits on favourable terms, provision with uncontaminated cotton cooking oil and seed cake as animal feed, marketing support as well as extension and training, services provided by the newly established organic service provider. A big majority of organic farmers perceives an improvement of soil qualities, improved health conditions, and positively assesses their previous decision to convert to organic farming. The major disadvantage of organic farming is the high manual labour input required. In the study area, where manual farm work is mainly women?s work and male labour migration widespread, women are most affected by this negative aspect of organic farming. Altogether, the results suggest that despite the inconvenience of higher work load the advantages of organic farming outweigh the disadvantages and that conversion to organic farming can improve the livelihoods of small-scale farmers.";2010;"economic, performance, impacts, motivation, conversion"
"3337";"Conference on Water Resources in Ethiopia";"Hans Hurni";"Data on rainfall, runoff and sediment loss from different land use types have been collected by the Soil Conservation Research Programme in seven small catchments (73-673 hectares) throughout the Ethiopian Highlands since the early 1980s. Monitoring was carried out on a storm-to-storm basis for extended periods of 10-20 years, and the data are analysed here to assess long-term effects of changes. Soil and water conservation technologies were introduced in the early years in the catchments in view of their capacity to reduce runoff and sediment yield. Results indicate that rainfall did not substantially change over the observation periods. Land use changes and land degradation, however, altered runoff, as shown by the data from small test plots (30 m2), which were not altered by conservation measures during the monitoring periods. Sediment delivery from the catchments may have decreased due to soil and water conservation, while runoff rates did not change significantly. Extrapolation of the results in the highlands, however, showed that expansion of cultivated and grazing land induced by population growth may have increased the overall surface runoff. Watershed management in the catchments, finally, had beneficial effects on ecosystem services by reducing soil erosion, restoring soil fertility, enhancing agricultural production, and maintaining overall runoff to the benefit of lowland areas and neighbouring countries.";2010;"rainfall, runoff, sediment, land use, conservation"

Contemporary research on migration is placed in a spectrum that ranges from exponents of economic benefits at one end, to those who see migration as a security threat, at the other. This paper combines the work of three researchers and looks at the different political locations from which the South Asian subject is induced to move.

Two main trends have characterised  the management of water, agricultural land and pastures since the country  became independent in 1991. First, while natural resources were collective  and state-owned during the Soviet period, they are now being gradually privatised and passed into individual or group ownership. Second, by contrast  with central administration under the Soviet regime, after independence  natural resource management has been and is increasingly being decentralised to the community level. We suggest that these processes have created  a new concept of the ?private?, defined as clearly assigned property rights as  opposed to ?commons?, and individual or group ownership as opposed to  ?public? ownership. We attempt here to analyse how privatisation and decentralisation have created new property relations and new forms of natural  resource governance. We conclude that these processes have yielded both  favourable and unfavourable outcomes.";2010;"continuity, change, privatisation, decentralisation, governance."

In areas with highly erodible soils, such as those in loess zones, application of soil and water conservation measures is crucial to sustain agricultural yields and to prevent or reduce land degradation. The present study, carried out in Faizabad, Tajikistan, was designed to evaluate the potential of local conservation measures on cropland using a spatial modelling approach to provide decision-making support for the planning of spatially explicit sustainable land use. A sampling design to support comparative analysis between well-conserved units and other field units was established in order to estimate factors that determine water erosion, according to the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE). Such factor-based approaches allow ready application using a geographic information system (GIS) and facilitate straightforward scenario modelling in areas with limited data resources. The study showed first that assessment of erosion and conservation in an area with inhomogeneous vegetation cover requires the integration of plot-based cover. Plot-based vegetation cover can be effectively derived from high-resolution satellite imagery, providing a useful basis for plot-wise conservation planning. Furthermore, thorough field assessments showed that 25.7% of current total cropland is covered by conservation measures (terracing, agroforestry and perennial herbaceous fodder). Assessment of the effectiveness of these local measures, combined with the RUSLE calculations, revealed that current average soil loss could be reduced through low-cost measures such as contouring (by 11%), fodder plants (by 16%), and drainage ditches (by 53%). More expensive measures such as terracing and agroforestry can reduce erosion by as much as 63% (for agroforestry) and 93% (for agroforestry combined with terracing). Indeed, scenario runs for different levels of tolerable erosion rates showed that more cost-intensive and technologically advanced measures would lead to greater reduction of soil loss. However, given economic conditions in Tajikistan, it seems advisable to support the spread of low-cost and labourextensive measures.";2010;"soil erosion, conservation, land use, GIS, measures"

Physical accessibility of natural resources, on the other hand, has generally been regarded as one of the most important drivers of land-use and land-cover changes. Based on two case studies, this article discusses evidence of the impact of access to services and access to natural resources on household poverty and on the environment. We show that socio-cultural distances are a key limiting factor for gaining access to services, and thereby for improved household welfare. We also discuss the impact of socio-cultural distances on access to natural resources, and show that large-scale commercial exploitation of natural resources tends to occur beyond the spatial reach of socio-culturally and economically marginalised population segments. We conclude that it is essential to pay more attention to improving the structural environment that presently leaves social minority groups marginalised. Innovative approaches that use natural resource management to induce poverty reduction ? for example, through compensation of local farmers for environmental services ? appear to be promising avenues that can lead to integration of the objectives of poverty reduction and sustainable environmental stewardship.";2010;"access, resources, poverty, environment, services"
"3378";"Bushfire and everyday life: Examining the awareness-action ?gap? in changing rural landscapes";"Christine Eriksen and Nicholas Gill";"In this paper we use the notion of ?everyday life? to critically examine an apparent ?gap? between bushfire risk awareness and preparedness amongst diverse landholders in rural landscapes affected by amenity-led in-migration in southeast Australia. Landholders were found to bring their own agency to bushfire preparedness in the relationships between everyday procedures, dilemmas, and tradeoffs. Consequently, regardless of landholders? awareness levels, attitudes towards bushfire and natural resource management influence if, how, and to what extent landowners prepare for bushfires. We argue that not only is the ?gap? complex but also paradoxical in that it is both evident in, and constituted by, landholder attitudes and action and simultaneously dissolved in their practices and decision-making in everyday life. Three dilemmas of everyday life in particular were found to underpin these attitudes: costs (in terms of monetary and time values), gender roles, and priorities. Using a mixed-methods research approach, this simultaneous cultural construction and material nature of bushfire in everyday life is mapped out through landholders? narratives and actions that embody living with fire on the land. The place of bushfire in landholders? everyday life has direct relevance to recent international discussions of the vulnerability of the growing number of people living in bushfire-prone rural?urban interface areas.";2010;"everyday, awareness, landholders, bushfire, preparedness"
"3379";"The gendered dimensions of bushfire in changing rural landscapes in Australia";"Christine Eriksen and Nicholas Gill and Lesley Head";"This paper examines gender differences in awareness, preparedness and attitudes towards bushfire amongst landholders in rural landscapes affected by amenity-led in-migration in southeast Australia. It considers the potential of conceptualising bushfire not as a gender-neutral natural phenomenon but as an important means by which traditional gender roles and power relations within rural landscapes are maintained. Landholders were found to uphold conventional views of bushfire management as ?men?s business? despite changing social circumstances. Consequently, key gender differences exist within landholders? bushfire risk awareness, bushfire knowledge, the perceived need for bushfire preparedness measures, the willingness to perform certain tasks, and the belief in personal capacity to act. We argue that covert and less visible as well as overt gender roles and traditions are important factors in understanding landholders? engagement with bushfire management. When gendered dimensions of bushfire are investigated in the context of hegemony, a paradox emerges between women choosing not to take control of their own bushfire safety and women being denied the opportunity to take control. The complex and contradictory actions and attitudes to bushfire that materialise through an analysis of gendered social experiences complicate attempts to create more gender-sensitive frameworks for bushfire management. The tenacious and embedded nature of gender role divisions within both public and private spheres was furthermore found to act as economic, social and political stumbling blocks for empowerment opportunities. Using a mixed-methods research approach, this paper maps out gendered dimensions of bushfire through landholders? narratives and actions. The implications of these dimensions for bushfire management have direct relevance to recent international discussions of the vulnerability of the growing number of people living in bushfire-prone rural?urban interface areas.";2010;"gender, awareness, preparedness, attitudes, landholders"

We investigated interannual variations of PSI in nine mountain regions of interest (ROI) between 2000 and 2008. For that purpose, a novel MODIS data set processed at the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing at 250 m spatial resolution was utilized. The extent of PSI exhibited significant interannual variations, with coefficients of variation ranging from 5% to 81% depending on the ROI. A strong negative relationship was found between PSI and positive degree-days (threshold 0?C) during the summer months in most ROIs, with linear correlation coefficients (r) being as low as r = ?0.90. In the European Alps and Scandinavia, PSI extent was significantly correlated with annual net glacier mass balances, with r = 0.91 and r = 0.85, respectively, suggesting that MODIS-derived PSI extent may be used as an indicator of net glacier mass balances. Validation of PSI extent in two land surface classifications for the years 2000 and 2005, GLC-2000 and Globcover, revealed significant discrepancies of up to 129% for both classifications. With regard to the importance of such classifications for land surface parameterizations in climate and land surface process models, this is a potential source of error to be investigated in future studies. The results presented here provide an interesting insight into variations of PSI in several ROIs and are instrumental for our understanding of sensitive mountain regions in the context of global climate change assessment.";2010;"ice, extent, variations, relationship, mass"

The National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) North-South provides financial and technical support for researchers so that they can effectively cooperate with policy-makers and practitioners. An analysis of 10 years of experience translating research into development practise in the NCCR North-South revealed the following four strategies as particularly relevant: a) research orientation towards the needs and interests of partners; b) implementation of promising methods and approaches; c) communication and dissemination of research results; and d) careful analysis of the political context through monitoring and learning approaches. The NCCR North-South experience shows that ?doing excellent research? is just one piece of the mosaic. It is equally important to join hands with non-academic partners from the very beginning of a research project, in order to develop and test new pathways for sustainable development. Capacity building ? in the North and South ? enables researchers to do both: To do excellent research and to make it relevant for development.";2010;"research, development, cooperation, strategies, capacity"
"3396";"Transdisciplinarity Net Conference";"Eva Heim and Claudia Michel and Anne Barbara Zimmermann and Thomas Michael Breu and Peter Messerli and Karl G{\"u";"Partnership Actions for Mitigating Syndromes (PAMS) are small transdisciplinary projects which bring scientific research insights from the NCCR North-South into policy and practice. They are implemented by researchers from different disciplines in collaboration with non-scientific actors. PAMS aim to implement and test approaches, methods and tools developed in research, in order to identify promising strategies and potentials for sustainable development. In this sense, they are solution-oriented.  This paper will provide insights into our experience with PAMS, with a special focus on the implementation of transdisciplinarity and its outcomes. From 2001 to 2010, 77 PAMS were implemented in Africa, Asia and Latin America. An internal evaluation of the first 55 projects was conducted in 2006. Results of this evaluation led to a refinement and improvement of the tool. A second internal evaluation is currently underway in the NCCR North-South. This evaluation will provide an overview of 22 new PAMS. We will look at partners involved, project beneficiaries, activities implemented, outcomes achieved, and lessons learnt.  In the first evaluation, transdisciplinarity was considered as ?a form of collaboration within scientific fields ? and as a form of continuous dialogue between research and society? (Messerli et al., 2007). The evaluation report concluded that this understanding of transdisciplinarity was not satisfactorily applied in the 55 projects. Only about half of the PAMS addressed mutual exchange between researchers and society. Some involved only one specific field of research and clearly lacked interdisciplinary co-operation, and most often knowledge was transferred mainly unilaterally from the scientific community to society, without society having any effect on science. It was therefore recommended to address transdisciplinarity more carefully in Phase 2 PAMS.  The second evaluation, which is currently under way, is analysing whether and how this recommendation has been met, based on criteria defined in the NCCR North-South?s Outcome Monitoring Strategy. The analysis is focusing on partners with whom researchers interact and investigating whether practices have changed both in research and society. We are also exploring the role of researchers in PAMS. Preliminary results show that researchers can assume different roles, from direct implementation, mediation, and promotion of social learning between different actors, to giving advice as neutral outsiders.";2010;"partnership, transdisciplinarity, implementation, evaluation, researchers"

Studies into tourism adaptation within the Swiss Alps have so far focused on the technical adaptation options of alpine stakeholders, rather than perceptions of adaptation to climate change at the operational and community level. This article investigates attitudes to adaptation in two alpine regions within Switzerland's well-established decentralized political framework, through semi-structured qualitative interviews. Stakeholders focused almost entirely on maintaining the status quo of winter tourism, through technical or marketing measures, with mixed attitudes towards climatic impacts. A matrix based on the relative internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and threats of adaptation measures (a SWOT framework) was used to assess the measures and suggest how stakeholders could capitalize on the new opportunities thrown up by climate change to create a competitive advantage. A comprehensive and collaborative planning approach is vital to enable policy makers and stakeholders to maximize opportunities, minimize the adverse effects of climate change on the local economy, and develop inclusive adaptation measures that benefit the entire region in order to create more sustainable social, economic and environmental structures.";2010;"climate change, alpine, tourism, adaptation, stakeholders"

Adaptations thus need to build the resilience of farming systems. Using ?resilient adaptation? as a concept, this study analyses how adaptations at farm and policy/institutional-levels contribute to the resilience of Sub-Saharan African agriculture. The developed tool, ?the Resilience Check?, provides socio-economic data which complements existing adaptation tools. The underlying development gaps such as insecure property rights, poverty, low self-organisation, inadequate climate data and infrastructure limit resilient adaptations. If farmers could implement recommended practices, existing measures and improved crops can address most impacts expected in the medium-term. However, resource use efficiency remains critical for all farm management types. Development-oriented adaptation measures are needed to provide the robust foundations for building resilience. Reaching the very poor remains a challenge and the externally driven nature of many interventions raises concern about their sustainability. The study recommends practical measures such as decentralising various services and integrating the action plans of the multilateral environmental agreements into one national action plan.";2010;"africa, climate, adaptation, resilience, agriculture"

Data were collected from a longitudinal survey of 127 agro-pastoral households. Approximately one-third of the households have inadequate feeds, and livestock diseases are major challenges during non-drought and drought periods. Agro-pastoralists? responses to drought are reactive and mainly involve intensifying exploitation of resources and the commons. Proactive responses such as improving production resources are few. Poverty, limited responses to market dynamics and inadequate skills constrain adaptations. Many agro-pastoralists? attachment to livestock deters livestock divestment, favouring disadvantageous sales that result in declining incomes. To improve adaptive capacity, interventions should expose agro-pastoralists to other forms of savings, incorporate agro-pastoralists as agents of change by building their capacity to provide extension services, and maintain infrastructure. Securing livestock mobility, pasture production and access is crucial under the variable social-ecological conditions.";2010;"drought, livestock, adaptation, poverty, capacity"

It examines ways of integrating IK into formal monitoring, how to enhance its value and acceptability. Data was collected through target interviews, group discussions and questionnaires covering 127 households in eight villages. Daily rainfall data from 1961?2003 were analysed. Results show that agro-pastoralists hold IK on indicators of rainfall variability; they believe in IK efficacy and they rely on them. Because agro-pastoralists consult additional sources, the authors interpret that IK forms a basic knowledge frame within which agro-pastoralists position and interpret meteorological forecasts. Only a few agro-pastoralists adapt their practices in anticipation of IK-based forecasts partly due to the conditioning of the actors to the high rainfall variability characteristic of the area and partly due to lack of resources. Non-drought factors such as poverty, inadequate resources and lack of preparedness expose agro-pastoralists to drought impacts and limit their adaptive capacity. These factors need to be understood and effectively addressed to increase agro-pastoralists? decision options and the influence of IK-based forecasts on their decision-making patterns. The limited intergenerational transfer of IK currently threatens its existence in the longer term. One way to ensure its continued existence and use is to integrate IK into the education curriculum and to link IK with formal climate change research through the participation of the local people. However, further studies are necessary to address the reliability and validity of the identified IK indicators of climate variability and change.";2010;"ik, agro-pastoralists, drought, adaptation, knowledge"

It provides a conceptual and methodological approach for a better understanding of interrelations between the performance of ecological and social systems. In the research area Alto Beni, Bolivia, the production of cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.), is one of the main sources of income. Farmers in the region have formed producers? associations to enhance organic cocoa cultivation and obtain fair prices since the 1980s. In cooperation with the long-term system comparisons by the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) in Alto Beni, aspects of the field trial are applied for the use in on-farm research: a comparison of soil fertility, biomass and crop diversity is combined with qualitative interviews and participatory observation methods. Fieldwork is carried out together with Bolivian students through the Swiss KFPE-programme Echanges Universitaires. For the system comparisons, four different land-use types were classified according to their ecological complexity during a preliminary study in 2009: successional agroforestry systems, simple agroforestry systems (both organically managed and certified), traditional systems and conventional monocultures. The study focuses on interrelations between different ways of cocoa cultivation, livelihoods and the related socio-cultural rationales behind them. In particular this second aspect is innovative as it allows to broaden the biophysical perspective to a more comprehensive evaluation with socio-ecological aspects thereby increasing the relevance of the agronomic field studies for development policy and practice. Moreover, such a socio-ecological baseline allows to assess the potential of organic agriculture regarding resilience-building face to socio-environmental stress factors. Among others, the results of the pre-study illustrate local farmers? perceptions of climate change and the consequences for the different crop-systems: all interviewees mentioned rising temperatures and/or an extended dry season as negative impacts more with regard to their own working conditions than to their crops. This was the case in particular for conventional monocultures and in plots where slash-and-burn cultivation was practised whereas for organic agroforestry systems the advantage of working in the shade was stressed indicating that their relevance rises in the context of climate change.";2010;"resilience, agroecology, livelihoods, organic, cocoa"

Specific phenological phases are used to define the beginning and the end of seasons that form phenological calendars. Phenological observations more closely capture the integrated seasonal rhythm than statistically derived means or thresholds from climate elements. They only provide approximate indicators of seasonal changes and cannot replace visible or directly measurable phenomena. Including abiotic observations such as the timing of frost, thawing, icing, snow and fog even provides seasonality descriptions beyond the vegetation period. The length and position of seasons within the year is a foundation for an integrated description of seasonality presented as a phenological season diagram. Phenological observations are the indispensable basis for an integral description of a seasonal classification and seasonality.

Plant phenological observations may only be recorded wherever there is vegetation. Fog, snow and ice are available as phenological para-meters wherever they appear. The singularity of phenological observations is the possibility of spatial intensification to a microclimatic scale where the equipment of meteorological measurements is too expensive for intensive campaigning. The omnipresence of region-specific phenological parameters allows monitoring for a spatially much more detailed assessment of climate change than with weather data. We demonstrate this concept with phenological observations with the use of a special network in the Canton of Berne, Switzerland, with up to 600 observations sites (more than 1 to 10 km? of the inhabited area). Classic cartography, gridding, the integration into a Geographic Information System GIS and large-scale analysis are the steps to a detailed knowledge of topoclimatic conditions of a mountainous area. Examples of urban phenology provide other types of spatially detailed applications. Large potential in phenological mapping in future analyses lies in combining traditionally observed species-specific phenology with remotely sensed and modelled phenology that provide strong spatial information.

The handling of potentially different meaningful spaces is decisive, when it comes to the negotiation of pathways towards the sustainable development of a WHS region. Due to the fact that ? in a pluralistic world ? multiple realities exist, they have to be taken seriously and adequately addressed.  In this article we identified the ways the Jungfrau-Aletsch- WHS was constructed by exploring the visual and verbal representations of the WHS during the decision-making process (1998-2001). The results demonstrate that in the visual representations (images), the WHS was to a large extent presented as an unspoiled natural environment similar to a touristy promotion brochure. Such a ?picture-book?-like portrait has no direct link to the population?s daily needs, their questions and anxieties about the consequences of a WHS label. By contrast, the verbal representations (articles, letters-to-the-editor, comments) were dominated by issues concerning the economic development of the region, fears of disappropriation, and different views on nature. Whereas visual and verbal representations to a large extent differ significantly, their combination might have contributed to the final decision of the majority of people concerned to support the application for inscription of the Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn region into the World Heritage list. The prominence of economic arguments and narratives about intergenerational responsibility in the verbal representations and their combination with the aesthetic appeal of the natural environment in the visual representations might have built a common meaningful space for one part of the population.";2010;"biography, meaning, negotiation, representations, development"

Discussions of the World Heritage issue over a time span of 4 years revealed how the region concerned was discursively constructed and that discursive constructions implied specific views of nature. By elaborating on these conflicting views of nature, we intend to reflect on the implicit meanings that influenced and structured the debate about the WHS and more generally the issues of sustainable regional development. The results show a broadening of the debate from a rather fragmented toward a more inclusive view of nature, which relates to basic assumptions of the global discourse on sustainable development. Additionally, a view of nature as inherited from past generations extended the WHS discussion and thus gave a new dimension to the concept of sustainability.";2010;"negotiation, media, discourse, nature, sustainable"

A variety of SLM measures have already been applied at the local level, but they are rarely adequately recognised, evaluated, shared or used for decision support. WOCAT (World Overview of Technologies and Approaches) has developed an internationally recognised, standardised methodology to document and evaluate SLM technologies and approaches, including spatial distribution, allowing the sharing of SLM knowledge worldwide. The recent methodological integration into a participatory process allows now analysing and using this knowledge for decision support at the local and national level. The use of the WOCAT tools stimulates evaluation (self-evaluation as well as learning from comparing experiences) within SLM initiatives where all too often there is not only insufficient monitoring but also a lack of critical analysis. The comprehensive questionnaires and database system facilitate to document, evaluate and disseminate local experiences of SLM technologies and their implementation approaches. This evaluation process - in a team of experts and together with land users - greatly enhances understanding of the reasons behind successful (or failed) local practices. It has now been integrated into a new methodology for appraising and selecting SLM options. The methodology combines a local collective learning and decision approach with the use of the evaluated global best practices from WOCAT in a concise three step process: i) identifying land degradation and locally applied solutions in a stakeholder learning workshop; ii) assessing local solutions with the standardised WOCAT tool; iii) jointly selecting promising strategies for implementation with the help of a decision support tool. The methodology has been implemented in various countries and study sites around the world mainly within the FAO LADA (Land Degradation Assessment Project) and the EU-funded DESIRE project. Investments in SLM must be carefully assessed and planned on the basis of properly documented experiences and evaluated impacts and benefits: concerted efforts are needed and sufficient resources must be mobilised to tap the wealth of knowledge and learn from SLM successes.";2010;"desertification, prevention, mitigation, sustainable, learn"

A Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) investigates interannual to interdecadal covariability between a new gridded SLP field reconstruction and seven long instrumental temperature series covering the past 250 years. We then present and discuss prominent atmospheric circulation patterns related to anomalous warm and cold JFMA conditions within different European areas spanning the period 1760?2007. Next, using a data assimilation technique, we link gridded SLP data with a climate model (EC-Bilt-Clio) for a better dynamical understanding of the relationship between large scale circulation and European climate. We thus present an alternative approach to reconstruct climate for the pre-instrumental period based on the assimilated model simulations. Furthermore, we present an independent method to extend the dynamic circulation analysis for anomalously cold European JFMA conditions back to the sixteenth century. To this end, we use documentary records that are spatially representative for the long instrumental records and derive, through modern analogs, large-scale SLP, surface temperature and precipitation fields. The skill of the analog method is tested in the virtual world of two three-dimensional climate simulations (ECHO-G and HadCM3). This endeavor offers new possibilities to both constrain climate model into a reconstruction mode (through the assimilation approach) and to better asses documentary data in a quantitative way.";2010;"temperature, circulation, europe, model, reconstruction"

It is a dynamic and evolving concept that also embraces innovations and complementation from other than endogenous sources of knowledge; however, only as far as they are based on mutual respect and the recognition of cultural and socioeconomic self-determination of each of the parties involved. Experiences that have been systematized in the context of the BioAndes Program are demonstrating that enhancing food security and food sovereignty on the basis of endogenous development can be best achieved by applying a ?biocultural? perspective: This means to promote and support actions that are simultaneously valuing biological (fauna, flora, soils, or agrobiodiversity) and sociocultural resources (forms of social organization, local knowledge and skills, norms, and the related worldviews). In Bolivia, that is one of the Latin-American countries with the highest levels of poverty (79% of the rural population) and undernourishment (22% of the total population), the Program BioAndes promotes food sovereignty and food security by revitalizing the knowledge of Andean indigenous people and strengthening their livelihood strategies. This starts by recognizing that Andean people have developed complex strategies to constantly adapt to highly diverse and changing socioenvironmental conditions. These strategies are characterized by organizing the communities, land use and livelihoods along a vertical gradient of the available eco-climatic zones; the resulting agricultural systems are evolving around the own sociocultural values of reciprocity and mutual cooperation, giving thus access to an extensive variety of food, fiber and energy sources. As the influences of markets, competition or individualization are increasingly affecting the life in the communities, people became aware of the need to find a new balance between endogenous and exogenous forms of knowledge. In this context, BioAndes starts by recognizing the wealth and potentials of local practices and aims to integrate its actions into the ongoing endogenous processes of innovation and adaptation. In order to avoid external impositions and biases, the program intervenes on the basis of a dialogue between exogenous, mainly scientific, and indigenous forms of knowledge. The paper presents an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of enhancing endogenous development through a dialogue between scientific and indigenous knowledge by specifically focusing on its effects on food sovereignty and food security in three ?biocultural? rural areas of the Bolivian highlands.

The LCI data used for the comparison were local Brazilian LCI data, European LCI data in its original version from the ecoinvent database and a modified version of the European LCI data, which had been adapted to better account for the Brazilian situation. We compared the three established datasets at the level of the inventory as well as for their environmental impacts, i.e. at the level of Life Cycle Environmental Assessment (LCIA). The analysis showed that the European LCIs (both the original and the modified ones) considered a broader spectrum of background processes and environmental flows (inputs and outputs). Nevertheless, TSP production had in all three cases similar values for the consumption of the main raw materials. The LCIA results obtained for the datasets showed important differences as well. Therefore we concluded that the European data in general lead to much higher environmental impacts than the Brazilian data. The differences between the LCIA results obtained with the Brazilian and the European data can be basically explained by the methodological differences underlying the data. The small differences at the LCI level for selected inputs and outputs between the Brazilian and the European LCIs from ecoinvent indicate that the latter can be regarded as applicable for characterizing the Brazilian TSP.";2010;"evaluation, life cycle inventory, environmental impacts, european data, brazilian data"

The study showed that farmers interpret soil erosion and soil conservation measures against the background of their entire life-world. By doing so, farmers consider abstract and symbolic meanings of soil conservation. This is, soil conservation measures have to be feasible and practical in the everyday farming routine, however, they also have to correspond with their aesthetic perception, their value system and their personal and professional identities. Consequently, by switching to soil conservation measures such as no-tillage farmers have to adapt not only the routines of their daily farming life, but also their perception of the aesthetics of cultivated land, underlying values and images of themselves. Major differences between farmers who adopt and farmers who reject no-tillage were found to depend on the degree of coherence they could create between the abstract and symbolic meanings of the soil conservation measure. From this perspective, implementation of soil protection measures faces the challenge of facilitating interactions between farmers, experts and scientists at a ?deeper? level, with an awareness of all significant dimensions that characterise the life-world. The paper argues that a certain level of shared symbolic meaning is essential to achieving mutual understanding in social learning processes.";2010;"life-worlds, farmers, soil conservation, social learning, symbolic meaning"

Despite these limitations, snowbed vegetation usually forms a dense carpet of palatable plants due to favourable abiotic conditions for plant growth within the short growing season. These environmental characteristics make snowbeds particularly interesting to study the interplay of facilitation and competition. We hypothesised an interplay between resource competition and facilitation against herbivory. Further, we investigated whether these predicted neighbour effects were species-specific and/or dependent on ontogeny, and whether the balance of positive and negative plant?plant interactions shifted along a snowmelt gradient. We determined the neighbour effects by means of neighbour removal experiments along the snowmelt gradient, and linear mixed model analyses. The results showed that the effects of neighbour removal were weak but generally consistent among species and snowmelt dates, and depended on whether biomass production or survival was considered. Higher total biomass and increased fruiting in removal plots indicated that plants competed for nutrients, water, and light, thereby supporting the hypothesis of prevailing competition for resources in snowbeds. However, the presence of neighbours reduced herbivory and thereby also facilitated survival. For plant growth the facilitative effects against herbivores in snowbeds counterbalanced competition for resources, leading to a weak negative net effect. Overall the neighbour effects were not species-specific and did not change with snowmelt date. Our finding of counterbalancing effects of competition and facilitation within a plant community is of special theoretical value for species distribution models and can explain the success of models that give primary importance to abiotic factors and tend to overlook interrelations between biotic and abiotic effects on plants.";2010;"alpine, snowbeds, herbivory, competition, facilitation"

For this purpose we analyse a series of studies carried out in the area of the Swiss Alps Jungfrau-Aletsch World Heritage Site (WHS). The approaches used in these studies to analyse the diversity and development of the region included data collection and evaluation of indicators such as population development, number of working places, occupation rates in various economic sectors and commuter balance, as well as interviews with key informants and assessment of existing planning tools. The major challenge of the newly declared World Heritage Region is that it is neither a political or administrative nor a cultural unit but constitutes a completely new type of space that breaks up and crosses traditional boundaries. The studies revealed an economic tertiarisation process and migration of the population from remote areas to regional centres. Tourism was identified as the key economic sector in the region. Regarding regional sustainability, the studies identified a need for quality dialogue and negotiation of interests and stakes. It was shown that in dealing with sustainability at the local level, many key issues cannot be resolved on the ground, as they depend on regional or national decisions, e.g. the conditions for tourism promotion in the region or economic validation of agricultural activity. We conclude from these findings that national or even international factors do not provide a basis for location-specific solutions, as they are often too general, and that the global label does not ensure sustainability in a designated WHS region; this depends entirely on local and regional dynamics.";2010;"global, local, conservation, development, alps"

Several methods are available for their correction at monthly and annual scales, whereas few exist for daily data. Here, an improved version of the higher-order moments (HOM) method, the higher-order moments for autocorrelated data (HOMAD), is proposed. HOMAD addresses the main weaknesses of HOM, namely, data autocorrelation and the subjective choice of regression parameters. Simulated series are used for the comparison of both methodologies. The results highlight and reveal that HOMAD outperforms HOM for small samples. Additionally, three daily temperature time series from stations in the eastern Mediterranean are used to show the impact of homogenization procedures on trend estimation and the assessment of extremes. HOMAD provides an improved correction of daily temperature time series and further supports the use of corrected daily temperature time series prior to climate change assessment.";2010;"inhomogeneities, autocorrelated, moments, homogenization, climate"
"3517";"Characterisation of extreme winter precipitation in Mediterranean coastal sites and associated anomalous atmospheric circulation patterns";"Andrea Toreti and Eleni Xoplaki and Douglas Maraun and Franz-Gunther Kuglitsch and Heinz Wanner and J{\"u";"We present an analysis of daily extreme precipitation events for the extended winter season (October?March) at 20 Mediterranean coastal sites covering the period 1950?2006. The heavy tailed behaviour of precipitation extremes and estimated return levels, including associated uncertainties, are derived applying a procedure based on the Generalized Pareto Distribution, in combination with recently developed methods. Precipitation extremes have an important contribution to make seasonal totals (approximately 60% for all series). Three stations (one in the western Mediterranean and the others in the eastern basin) have a 5-year return level above 100 mm, while the lowest value (estimated for two Italian series) is equal to 58 mm. As for the 50-year return level, an Italian station (Genoa) has the highest value of 264 mm, while the other values range from 82 to 200 mm. Furthermore, six series (from stations located in France, Italy, Greece, and Cyprus) show a significant negative tendency in the probability of observing an extreme event. The relationship between extreme precipitation events and the large scale atmospheric circulation at the upper, mid and low troposphere is investigated by using NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data. A 2-step classification procedure identifies three significant anomaly patterns both for the western-central and eastern part of the Mediterranean basin. In the western Mediterranean, the anomalous southwesterly surface to mid-tropospheric flow is connected with enhanced moisture transport from the Atlantic. During ?5-year return level events, the subtropical jet stream axis is aligned with the African coastline and interacts with the eddy-driven jet stream. This is connected with enhanced large scale ascending motions, instability and leads to the development of severe precipitation events. For the eastern Mediterranean extreme precipitation events, the identified anomaly patterns suggest warm air advection connected with anomalous ascent motions and an increase of the low- to mid-tropospheric moisture. Furthermore, the jet stream position (during ?5-year return level events) supports the eastern basin being in a divergence area, where ascent motions are favoured. Our results contribute to an improved understanding of daily precipitation extremes in the cold season and associated large scale atmospheric features.";2010;"extreme, mediterranean, precipitation, circulation, winter"

This is a complex societal problem that calls for a knowledge-based solution. This in turn requires a transdisciplinary research framework in which problems are defined and solved cooperatively by actors from the scientific community and the life-world. In this article we re-examine studies carried out in the region of the Swiss Alps Jungfrau-Aletsch WHS, covering three key issues prevalent in transdisciplinary settings: integration of stakeholders into participatory processes; perceptions and positions; and negotiability and implementation. In the case of the Swiss Alps Jungfrau-Aletsch WHS the transdisciplinary setting created a situation of mutual learning among stakeholders from different levels and backgrounds. However, the studies showed that the benefits of such processes of mutual learning are continuously at risk of being diminished by the power play inherent in participatory approaches.";2010;"conservation, economic, development, management, transdisciplinary"

In this way it contributes to an area of rural development that is gaining increasing interest, but still has little empirical evidence. Data were collected through interviews, focus group discussions, informal discussions and the study of reports. One of the key findings of this article is that diversification into enterprises requires cooperation among the stakeholders with their varying experiences in development, NRM and business development. In addition to initial investments, such enterprises need sustained financial, as well as other support like capacity development to survive the market introduction phase. For such enterprises to defend their market niches, the quantity and quality of the product are critical. In addition to support in human, financial, social, physical and natural capital, mentoring is another crucial factor for success.";2010;"agro-pastoral, livelihoods, bio-enterprise, NRM, Kenya"
